What is treatment of hepatitis C dependent upon?,"Until recently, the most common method was a blend of shots and pills. Genotypes 4, 5 and 6 are very rare in the U. S. Treatment now centers around direct acting antiviral drugs ( DAAs). Ask your doctor what's best for you, based on your medical needs."
How does the eligibility for Individualized Education Program (IEP) start?,"If the district makes the request, your consent is needed before the evaluation can be done. The evaluation is what determines that your child is eligible for special education. If you think your child's evaluation isn't accurate, you can ask for an independent evaluation. The IEP will be tailored to your child's needs and abilities."
What causes rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)?,"People who have the condition sometimes work hard to make everyone like and admire them. When you have ADHD, your nervous system overreacts to things from the outside world. Any sense of rejection can set off your stress response and cause an emotional reaction that's much more extreme than usual. Sometimes the criticism or rejection is imagined, but not always. ADHD researchers estimate that by age 12, children with ADHD get 20,000 more negative messages about themselves than other kids their age. All that criticism can take a real toll on their self-esteem."
How is rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) treated?,"This is sometimes called rejection sensitive dysphoria ( RSD). "" If you have ADHD and you've had any of these symptoms, see a psychologist, counselor, or other mental health provider for help. But a therapist can help you learn how to get a handle on your emotions and deal with rejection in a more positive way. Another way to deal with RSD is to manage the stress in your life. You're more likely to have an emotional breakdown when you're stressed out. Eat right, sleep well, and do things like yoga or meditation to keep your mind calm."
How can heart failure lead to kidney damage or failure?,"Your heart has four valves that open and close to keep blood flowing in and out of your heart. Just like your other organs, they need a steady supply of blood to work like they should. Without the amount of blood they need, they won't be able to remove enough wastes from your blood. It's treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. Kidney disease can also make your heart failure worse. Damaged kidneys they can't remove as much water from your blood as healthy ones. You'll start to hold onto fluid, which boosts your blood pressure. High blood pressure makes your heart work even harder. This is called pulmonary edema."
How does heart failure affect your lungs?,"When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body. A damaged heart can't pump blood as effectively from your lungs out to your body. This pushes fluid into your air sacs. As liquid builds up, it gets harder to breathe. This is called pulmonary edema."
How can heart failure lead to lung problems?,"When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body. A damaged heart can't pump blood as effectively from your lungs out to your body. This pushes fluid into your air sacs. As liquid builds up, it gets harder to breathe. This is called pulmonary edema."
How can heart failure lead to liver damage?,"When you have heart failure, your heart may not be strong enough to pump out as much blood as your body needs. It also pumps faster, and your blood vessels narrow to get more blood out to your body. Heart failure can rob your liver of the blood it needs to work. The fluid buildup that comes with it puts extra pressure on the portal vein, which brings blood to your liver. This can scar the organ to the point where it doesn't work as well as it should."
How does heart failure affect your body?,"As it tries to move more blood, your heart gets larger. It also pumps faster, and your blood vessels narrow to get more blood out to your body. As your heart works harder, it becomes weaker and the damage increases. Your body gets less oxygen, and you might notice symptoms like shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, and fluid buildup. Your body tries to keep the blood it has to supply your heart and brain. This leaves less for organs like your kidneys and liver. A lack of enough blood can damage these organs. When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body."
How is ductal carcinoma in situ treated?,"The treatment options are usually: Lumpectomy: The surgeon only removes the tumor and a bit of the tissue around it to help make sure all the cancer cells have been removed. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy. Instead, they have a lumpectomy. Most common is a lumpectomy followed by radiation. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it. Lymph nodes under the arm don't need to be removed as they are with other types of breast cancer."
What is the treatment plan for ductal carcinoma in situ based on?,"The invasive cancer usually develops in the same breast and in the same area as where the DCIS happened. Your doctor will customize your treatment plan based on your test results and medical history. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy."
When do you need radiation for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ?,"It uses low doses of radiation to make pictures of the inside of your chest. It can be local, regional, and/or distant. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it. After a lumpectomy, radiation cuts the chances that the cancer will come back. If cancer does return, it's called recurrence. Some women may opt to have a lumpectomy only."
How is invasive ductal carcinoma treated?,"Most women with IDC have surgery to remove the cancer. Which one you get depends on the size of your tumor and how much it has spread throughout your breast and surrounding lymph nodes. In addition to surgery, other treatments include: Radiation: This usually follows your surgery."
What procedures are done to treat invasive ductal carcinoma?,"Chemotherapy: These medications target cancer cells throughout your body. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it."
What tests are used to further diagnose invasive ductal carcinoma?,"Invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) accounts for about 80% of all invasive breast cancers in women and 90% in men. PET scan. The doctor injects a radioactive substance called a tracer into your arm. Together with a CT scan, this test can help find cancer in lymph nodes and other areas. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the breast and other structures inside your body. Bone scan. It uses low doses of radiation to make pictures of the inside of your chest. Results from these tests will show the stage of your cancer. Node ( N): Has the tumor spread to your lymph nodes? These tests may include an ultrasound or MRI."
Should I tell my friends and family about my type 2 diabetes?,"Type 2 diabetes can seem overwhelming at times, but you can take control back. Share with them what you're going through and how you manage your diabetes. For instance, tell them why you have to check your blood sugar regularly, or what sorts of snacks and meals are OK for you. Want someone to help you get them up to speed?"
What can help for my type 2 diabetes?,"Put them on your go-to list, and reach out any time you need their insight and motivation. It helps to talk to someone who can relate to what you're going through, since they have diabetes, too. Type 2 diabetes can affect the entire family."

How can I tell my family about my type 2 diabetes?,"You might want to hold a family meeting, and invite your diabetes educator to answer their questions. Pick someone you find easy to talk to."
What are the causes of IBS and IBD?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. The long-lasting inflammation in the digestive tracts of people with IBD can cause bleeding and ulcers (sores). In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. Scientists have found links between irritable bowel syndrome and the immune system, and how muscles move food through the gut. Many people have certain triggers that cause their symptoms to get worse, including some foods, stress, infections, and hormonal changes."
Do any specific diet changes help treat IBS?,"People with IBS often try to treat it by changing what they eat. There is no specific diet that works for everyone who has the condition. Stop lactose, which is in dairy products. Cut down on foods that make you gassy or bloated. Get more water. Avoid caffeine and legumes (beans). Limit or avoid â FODMAPsâ (a certain type of sugar found in some fruit, vegetable, bread and dairy products)."
What causes irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and irritable bowel disease (IBD)?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. The long-lasting inflammation in the digestive tracts of people with IBD can cause bleeding and ulcers (sores). In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. The causes of IBS aren't as clear."

There is no specific diet that works for everyone who has the condition. Cut down on foods that make you gassy or bloated. Get more water. ( You can drink it or eat H2 O-rich foods.) Avoid caffeine and legumes (beans). Limit or avoid â FODMAPsâ (a certain type of sugar found in some fruit, vegetable, bread and dairy products)."
How do doctors diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"Doctors use something called the â Rome criteriaâ to decide if you have irritable bowel syndrome. According to the criteria, you may be diagnosed with IBS if you have belly pain for at least 1 day a week for the previous 3 months. The pain must also meet at least two of the following: It is associated with a bowel movement. In some cases, doctors will diagnose you with IBS just using these standards. But in many cases, especially if you also have other symptoms that hint at IBD, you'll get tests to find out whether there's any bleeding or inflammation in your digestive tract. If there is, then you don't have IBS."
Is irritable bowel disease (IBS) a structural or functional disease?,"IBS, on the other hand, is what doctors call a functional disease. Someone with this type of disease will have a group of symptoms, but tests won't show any physical explanation for those problems. Since it's a structural disease, a doctor needs to find physical damage in your gut to make the diagnosis."
What are some links between irritable bowel syndrome and the immune system?,"In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. Many people have certain triggers that cause their symptoms to get worse, including some foods, stress, infections, and hormonal changes."
Is IBD a structural or functional disease?,"IBS, on the other hand, is what doctors call a functional disease.

But in many cases, especially if you also have other symptoms that hint at IBD, you'll get tests to find out whether there's any bleeding or inflammation in your digestive tract."
How is kidney disease treated?,"Eat a proper diet. For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease, the most important treatment is to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB) drugs lower blood pressure and can protect the kidneys from further damage, but treatments need to be individualized."
What are interactions that can occur from taking flaxseed?,"If you have lupus -- or any other medical condition -- it's very important to talk with your doctor about any supplements you take. Flaxseed may block the normal absorption of medicines. Always take medicines at least one hour before or two hours after using flaxseed. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil may also interact with drugs like blood thinners, NSAID painkillers, hormone treatments, and some medicines for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes."
How much flaxseed should you take?,"There is no set dose of flaxseed. In studies of people with high cholesterol, 15 to 50 grams of flaxseed per day has been used; 40 grams have been used for mild menopause symptoms. Flaxseed must be ground prior to ingestion or it won't work for these conditions. To be absorbed, however, it must me ground before using it to allow the oils to be available. Some people use a small coffee grinder to grind daily doses as needed."
What causes vaginismus?,"The pain happens only with penetration. It's usually linked to anxietyand fear of having sex. But it's unclear which came first, the vaginismus or the anxiety. Other medical problems like infections can also cause painful intercourse. So it's important to see a doctor to determine the underlying cause of pain during sex."
What exercise or therapy can help prevent vaginismus?,"Relax the muscles. You can do them as many times a day as you want to. After a few days, insert one finger, up to about the first knuckle joint, inside the vagina while doing the exercises. It's a good idea to clip your fingernails first and use a lubricating jelly. For women whose vaginismus is related to fear or anxiety, therapy helps."
What are symptoms of vaginismus?,"When a woman has vaginismus, her vagina's muscles squeeze or spasm when something is entering it, like a tampon or a penis. It usually goes away after withdrawal, but not always. Many women who have vaginismus also feel discomfort when inserting a tampon or during a doctor's internal pelvic exam. Others have it only in certain circumstances, like with one partner but not others, or only with sexual intercourse but not with tampons or during medical exams."
What is the treatment for vaginismus?,"The approach is called progressive desensitization, and the idea is to get comfortable with insertion. Relax the muscles."
What should you know about treating minor cuts and scrapes?,"All it takes is one slip of focus while slicing bread and you've cut your finger. Or you trip on a curb and skin your knee. Get immediate medical attention for a wound that is deep, bleeds heavily, or has something embedded in it. Stop the Bleeding A small amount of blood can help clean out the wound."
How does occupational asthma occur?,"These substances may cause asthma in one of 3 ways: An allergic reaction (like people with allergies who develop allergic asthma) An irritant reaction (like a person that reacts to smoking with asthma) A reaction which results in the buildup of naturally occurring chemicals such as histamines in the lungs resulting in an asthma attack Examples of occupational asthma -- also called work-related asthma -- include: Health care workers who develop an allergy to latex gloves by breathing in the powdered proteins from the inner lining of the gloves Workers in the chemical industry who are exposed to substances like ammonia and develop symptoms of asthma as the result of an irritant effects, not an allergic reaction There are numerous substances used in various industries that can trigger occupational asthma including: Chemicals such as adhesives, shellac and lacquer, plastics, epoxy resins, carpeting, foam and rubber, insulation, dyes (textile workers), and enzymes in detergents Proteins in animal hair and/or dander Grains, green coffee beans, and papain (an extract of papaya that may trigger a latex allergy) Cotton, flax, and hemp dust, commonly found in the textile industry Metals such as platinum, chromium, nickel sulfate, and soldering fumes Generally, if your asthma symptoms are worse on days that you work, improve when you are at home for any length of time (weekends, vacations) and then recur when you return to work, occupational asthma should be considered. Preventing asthma symptoms by reducing exposure to the triggers at work is the most important step you can take to reduce the occurrence of occupational asthma."
How can my workplace help me with my occupational asthma?,"These substances may cause asthma in one of 3 ways: An allergic reaction (like people with allergies who develop allergic asthma) An irritant reaction (like a person that reacts to smoking with asthma) A reaction which results in the buildup of naturally occurring chemicals such as histamines in the lungs resulting in an asthma attack Examples of occupational asthma -- also called work-related asthma -- include: Health care workers who develop an allergy to latex gloves by breathing in the powdered proteins from the inner lining of the gloves Workers in the chemical industry who are exposed to substances like ammonia and develop symptoms of asthma as the result of an irritant effects, not an allergic reaction There are numerous substances used in various industries that can trigger occupational asthma including: Chemicals such as adhesives, shellac and lacquer, plastics, epoxy resins, carpeting, foam and rubber, insulation, dyes (textile workers), and enzymes in detergents Proteins in animal hair and/or dander Grains, green coffee beans, and papain (an extract of papaya that may trigger a latex allergy) Cotton, flax, and hemp dust, commonly found in the textile industry Metals such as platinum, chromium, nickel sulfate, and soldering fumes Generally, if your asthma symptoms are worse on days that you work, improve when you are at home for any length of time (weekends, vacations) and then recur when you return to work, occupational asthma should be considered. However, if in a particular job, exposure to asthma triggers is unavoidable, most employers are willing to assist the employee to find a more suitable workplace. Once it has been determined what causes your asthma, discuss with your health care provider how best to approach your employer and what precautions need to be taken."
What is the best age for a child to begin behavioral therapy for ADHD?,"If your child has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), your doctor will probably recommend behavioral therapy as a treatment.

What are guidelines for taking medication for paranoid schizophrenia?,"Avoid using marijuana, alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, or other stimulants. They can keep antipsychotic drugs from working well. They can also cause paranoia or make it worse. You might have to take different kinds of drugs for other symptoms, too. A kind of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy can teach you how to manage symptoms that don't go away, even when you take your medicine."
What are the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia?,"Delusions are fixed beliefs that seem real to you, even when there's strong evidence they aren't. Paranoid delusions, also called delusions of persecution, reflect profound fear and anxiety along with the loss of the ability to tell what's real and what's not real. They might make you feel like: A co-worker is trying to hurt you, like poison your food. And if you think that strangers are going to hurt you, you may feel like staying inside or being alone."
Are paranoid schizophrenics usually violent?,"This can make it hard for them to hold a job, run errands, have friendships, and even go to the doctor.

When does a paranoid schizophrenia require hospitalization?,"You might have to take different kinds of drugs for other symptoms, too. You'll be cared for so you and your loved ones stay safe. If you recognize that you're having trouble, you can be admitted voluntarily. But if you think you don't need help when you really do, the law may allow a doctor or other mental health professional to admit you involuntarily if you are unable to care for yourself or may be dangerous to yourself or someone else."
How can you recover from transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer?,"It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. You may need to have it in for a few days before you can go on your own. Drink lots of fluid to help flush out your bladder -- aim for 8 to 10 glasses per day. This also can help keep an infection away. Don't lift anything heavy for 2 to 3 weeks after your surgery. Short walks are OK, but don't do any intense exercise for 4 to 6 weeks. Talk with your doctor about when you can drive and go back to work."
How is transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer done?,"It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. He'll pass it up through your urethra into your bladder. The camera shows the surgeon the inside of your bladder. He'll use the cutting tool to take some tissue, then he'll use heat on the areas around the cut to stop the bleeding. The tissue that's taken out during the surgery will be looked at under a microscope in a lab to see if it's cancer. If your surgeon removed a cancerous tumor, she may put a liquid medication into your bladder to kill any cancer cells that are left."
What happens after transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer?,"It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. He'll get to your bladder through your urethra -- the tube pee goes through as it passes out of your body. The camera shows the surgeon the inside of your bladder. You may need to have it in for a few days before you can go on your own. If you do, be sure to let your doctor or nurse know. A numbing gel can help. Many people go home the same day as the surgery. But if your tumor was large, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight. You may see blood in your pee for up to 3 days after your surgery."
What might cause weight gain during breast cancer treatment?,"Many things can play a role. Chemotherapy can bring on premature menopause. Menopause also causes you to gain more body fat and lose lean muscle. It's common for women who have chemotherapy to gain about 5 to 14 pounds over a year. Some gain less, while others put on as many as 25 pounds. Weight loss can cause you to lose energy, and poor nutrition can make it harder for you to recover."

Who is more likely to have urea cycle disorders (UCDs)?,"They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons."
Are natural bug repellants safe for babies over 2 months old?,"The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) is clear: Bug repellents -- even the DEET-free ones -- are not safe for newborns. They aren't as long-lasting, though, and they can irritate your baby's skin."

How is a chest x-ray used to screen for lung cancer?,"If your doctor thinks you might have cancer because of your symptoms or your screening test, you may need to take some of these exams: Sputum Cytology. It uses radiation in low doses to make images of your lungs."
What is the purpose of a screening test for lung cancer?,"The heads up would let you start treatment early, when the condition is easier to fight. If your screening shows you may have lung cancer, your doctor will likely order up ""diagnostic"" tests. Those can pinpoint the type of the disease and whether it's spread to other places in the body.

Very rarely, they can lead to heart disease or sudden deaths. If they live where you do, here's what you need to know. Like mosquitoes and ticks, kissing bugs need blood to live."
What risk factors are linked to essential hypertension?,"High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood out to the body and contributes to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, to stroke, kidney disease, and to heart failure. Age and race also play a role. In the United States, blacks are twice as likely as whites to have high blood pressure, although the gap begins to narrow around age 44. After age 65, black women have the highest incidence of high blood pressure."
What happens during a heart CT scan?,"You'll lie on a special scanning table. The technologist will clean three small areas of your chest and place small, sticky electrode patches there. This will help your coronary arteries to show up. During the scan, you'll feel the table move inside a doughnut-shaped scanner. The high-speed CT scan gets many images, in sync with your heartbeat. The whole thing takes only a few minutes."

About 1,400 people a year get transverse myelitis, and about 33,000 people have some sort of disability as a result."
What causes transverse myelitis?,"More than half the time, doctors aren't sure what causes it. It's often linked to: Autoimmune conditions like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome that cause inflammation. Your doctor will run tests to figure out if you have transverse myelitis or some other condition."
How can neuromyelitis optica cause transverse myelitis?,"If you have this type, symptoms will show up on both sides of your body.

Electrocardiogram ( EKG): This records the electrical activity of your heart. Chest X-ray: It will let your doctor know if you have an enlarged heart. It can also show congestion. Echocardiogram: This uses sound waves to make a video image of your heart. Exercise test: You may hear this called a stress test. It will show any blockages or weakened arteries."
What is high-output heart failure?,"Usually, if you have heart failure, your heart isn't pumping enough blood through your body to help it work the way it should. With the high-output version, it's pumping a normal amount of blood -- or even more than normal. Still, your body isn't getting enough to help it work well. The things that lead to high-output heart failure are different from what brings other types of the condition. Many of the causes of high-output heart failure are curable."
How is high-output heart failure treated?,"The things that lead to high-output heart failure are different from what brings other types of the condition. It's a good idea to treat the underlying cause first. Your doctor may suggest other treatments, including a diet low in salt and water. You may also take diuretics (water pills) to help ease swelling. Taking traditional heart failure drugs will often not help. They can make things worse. There are medicines called vasoconstrictor adrenergics that can help by making your blood vessels smaller."
What causes cystic acne?,"When you're a teenager, androgens increase. This leads to changes in your skin that can result in clogged pores and acne. In women, hormone changes can be brought on by menstrual cycles, pregnancy, menopause, or a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome.

A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."" Sublingual or subcutaneous provocative challenge. It's similar to a skin test, but the sample of food allergen goes under your tongue or gets injected under your skin."
What should I know about food allergies or food intolerances?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and think they have a food allergy. A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. With a food intolerance, your immune system isn't responsible. For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly because of lactose intolerance. A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them."
What are non-approved treatments for food allergies?,"The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of Ig E for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. You regularly get small amounts of food extracts over a long period of time to help your body build up a kind of tolerance. But researchers haven't yet proven that allergy shots work for food allergies."
When is an immune complex assay used to diagnose food allergies?,"When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies. Immune complex assay. But these clusters normally form as part of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them."
How do food allergies work?,"Some people come from families where allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies, but perhaps hay fever, asthma, or hives. When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies. Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E ( Ig E), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood. The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of Ig E for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The Ig E gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that Ig E and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction."
What medications do doctors use to treat food allergies?,"Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. Medications can help relieve food allergy symptoms that aren't part of an anaphylactic reaction: Antihistamines for digestive issues, hives, and sneezing and a runny nose Bronchodilators for tightened airways or asthma-like symptoms But these won't prevent an allergic reaction if you take them before eating the food. No medication can."
What is an exercise-induced food allergy?,"As your body temperature goes up, you'll begin to itch, get lightheaded, and could have hives or even anaphylaxis. Fortunately, the cure is simple: Don't eat that food for a couple of hours before you work out. How much did you eat before the reaction started?"
How is cytotoxicity testing used to diagnose food allergies?,"So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food. A food allergen is added to your blood sample. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."""
What are some common food allergies in children?,"A food challenge, or feeding test, is another way to confirm or rule out an allergy. Milk and soy allergies are particularly common in infants and young children, probably because their immune and digestive systems are still developing. These allergies can appear within days to months of birth. They may not show up as hives and asthma, but rather lead to colic and perhaps blood in poop or poor growth. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula."
Can food allergies cause hyperactivity in children?,"In the lungs, they may cause wheezing. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them. A food allergy won't directly affect a child's behavior, although their symptoms might make them cranky and difficult, and allergy medications can make them sleepy."
How is a skin puncture test used to diagnose food allergies?,"A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response. One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness."
What is a controversial food allergy treatment?,"This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. Putting a dilute solution of a food under your tongue about a half hour before you eat it as a way to ""neutralize"" your exposure doesn't work either."
How is the IgG subclass assay used to diagnose food allergies?,Ig G subclass assay. No medication can.
What affects food-related allergic reactions?,"The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure. As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years."
How is a double-blind food challenge done to diagnose food allergies?,"Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. The digestion process affects the timing and the location. But sulfites are still used in some foods. Then you try eating that food again to see if the symptoms come back, which confirms the diagnosis. In a ""double-blind"" test, neither you or your doctor know if what you're eating has the allergen in it. This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. It's also expensive because it takes a lot of time. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."""
How are milk allergies treated in babies?,"Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. Gluten intolerance is related to celiac disease. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either."

People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes."
Does ginseng help with diabetes?,"Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first."
How does vanadium help with type 2 diabetes?,"Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages."
"What does ""alternative therapy"" mean for people with diabetes?","The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a ""group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.""

Many believe that clumping litters, which allow for the easy removal of solids and liquids, keep boxes smelling fresher. But cats can be very particular about which litters they will use. So experiment to find the litter your cat likes best, then stick with it. If a cat is on the third floor, and the box is in the basement, he may decide not to make the long trek."
Where should you put the cat litter box?,"Clean your scooper also. Don’t put a box in a small, enclosed area, like a tiny bathroom or closet, which will concentrate litter box odors. A larger, well-ventilated area is best. But it needs to be in a quiet, low-traffic area, away from your cat’s food, other pets, and anything that can startle or scare your cat while he’s using the box. Yes, it takes a daily effort on your part to keep litter box odors at bay. But the result will be a happier cat and a better-smelling home."

How can an artery spasm bring on a heart attack?,"While it is unusual, a heart attack can also be caused by a spasm of a coronary artery. Coronary arteries have a muscle lining which can contract or relax depending on the needs of the heart muscle at a given time. During a coronary spasm, the coronary arteries constrict or spasm without warning, reducing blood supply to the heart muscle and potentially causing a heart attack. The amount of damage to the heart muscle depends on the size of the area supplied by the blocked artery and the time between injury and treatment. Earlier treatment can reduce the impact of the heart attack."
How can a blocked artery bring on a heart attack?,"Heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to nourish it. Fatty matter, calcium, proteins and inflammatory cells build up within the arteries to form plaques of different sizes and consistencies. With the build-up of plaque, there is less delivery of oxygen to the heart muscle, especially when there is a demand for oxygen (during exertion or exercise) and chest pain or symptoms can develop. The outer surface of the plaque may rupture or crack and platelets (disc-shaped particles in the blood that help form blood clots) then come to the area to form blood clots around the plaque -- like a scab. If a blood clot totally obstructs the artery, the heart muscle can become starved for oxygen. This is called ischemia."
What tests are used to diagnose a heart attack?,"The electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG) can provide information about the extent and location of heart muscle damage. Blood may be drawn to measure levels of cardiac enzymes that indicate heart muscle damage. By measuring the levels of these enzymes, the doctor can determine approximately when the heart attack started. An echocardiogram (also called an echo) is an ultrasound test that can be used to learn how the heart is pumping overall and what areas might not be pumping normally. Cardiac catheterization."

The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That's often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren't working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal."

( ALT used to be called serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, or SGPT). Doctors often give the ALT test along with other liver tests. AST is another liver enzyme."
What other tests will you take in addition to an alanine aminotransferase test?,"The alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) test is a blood test that checks for liver damage. The ALT test can be done as part of a blood panel during a regular exam. AST is another liver enzyme. As with ALT, the levels of AST in your blood rise if your liver is damaged. Comparing ALT with AST levels gives your doctor more information about the health of your liver. The ALT-to- AST ratio can help your doctor figure out how severe the liver damage is and what might have caused it."

That was true regardless of which model they were given, though people who slept in the cheapest beds did report more lower back pain than those in the medium- and higher-priced beds. They noted that the average age of the participants' old beds was 9.5 years. The takeaway: If you've been sleeping on the same mattress for 9 or 10 years (or more), it's time to get a new one. Almost any new replacement is going to be better than the saggy foundation of an old mattress. But it may pay to spring for at least a mid-priced model."
How firm should a mattress be for lower back pain?,"The latest thinking is that there isn't one type of mattress that's best for everyone, including people with chronic back pain. They used either ""medium-firm"" or ""firm"" mattresses for 90 days. Those in the medium group reported the least amount of discomfort.
