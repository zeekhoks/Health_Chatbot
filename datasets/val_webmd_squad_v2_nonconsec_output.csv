What is blood glucose monitoring or testing?,"Blood glucose monitoring or testing: A method of testing how much sugar is in your blood; home blood-glucose monitoring involves pricking your finger with a lancing device, putting a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting the test strip into a blood-glucose-testing meter that displays your blood glucose level. Blood-sugar testing can also be done in the laboratory. Blood-glucose monitoring is recommended three or four times a day for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Depending on the situation, glucose checks before meals, two hours after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of the night, and before and after exercise, may be recommended. Home blood glucose monitoring: A way in which a person can test how much sugar is in the blood; also called ""self-monitoring of blood glucose."""
What is an antidiabetic agent?,"Antidiabetic agent: A substance that helps people with diabetes control the level of sugar in their blood (see insulin, oral diabetes medication). Oral diabetes medications: Medications that people take to lower the level of sugar in the blood; oral diabetes medications are prescribed for people whose pancreas still produces some insulin."
What is albuminuria?,"Albuminuria: When kidneys become damaged, they start to leak protein in the urine. Albumin is a small, abundant protein in the blood that passes through the kidney filter into the urine easier than other proteins. Albuminuria occurs in about 30%-45% of people who have had type 1 diabetes for at least 10 years. In people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the kidneys may already show signs of small amounts of protein spillage, called ""microalbuminuria."" This may be from the result of diabetes or from other diseases seen in conjunction with diabetes, like high blood pressure. Protein in the urine increases the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease. It also means that the person is at a particularly high risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. These lumps or indentations are called ""lipodystrophies."""
What is peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"People who have had diabetes for a long time may develop nephropathy. Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD): An abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart, usually the hands and feet; often occurs as a result of decreased blood flow and narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis; people who have had diabetes for a long time may develop PVD."
What is home blood glucose monitoring?,"Home blood glucose monitoring: A way in which a person can test how much sugar is in the blood; also called ""self-monitoring of blood glucose."" Home glucose monitoring tests whole blood (plasma and blood cell components); thus, the results can be different from lab values, which test plasma values of glucose. Typically, the lab plasma values can be higher than the glucose checks done at home with a glucose monitor. Self-blood glucose monitoring: See home blood glucose monitoring."
What is peripheral vascular disease?,"People who have had diabetes for a long time may develop nephropathy. Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD): An abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart, usually the hands and feet; often occurs as a result of decreased blood flow and narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis; people who have had diabetes for a long time may develop PVD."

Glucose tolerance test: A test to determine if a person has diabetes; the test is done in a lab or doctor's office in the morning before the person has eaten. First, a sample of blood is taken in the fasting state. Then the person drinks a liquid that has sugar in it. Two hours later, a second blood test is done. A fasting blood sugar equal to or greater than 126 mg/dl is considered diabetes. If the two-hour test result shows a blood sugar equal to or greater than 200 mg/dl, the person is considered to have diabetes. A two-hour blood glucose between 140 mg/dl and 199 mg/dl is classified as impaired glucose tolerance."
What is type 2 diabetes?,"Diabetes: See type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

What is coronary bypass surgery for treating advanced atherosclerosis?,"In an angioplasty, a doctor first introduces a catheter (a narrow tube) into an artery in the leg or arm. He or she sews this healthy vessel onto the coronary artery, rerouting blood around the clogged artery. Coronary artery bypass surgery -- or CABG (pronounced ""cabbage"") -- is the most commonly performed bypass surgery. CABG can provide relief from chest pain caused by atherosclerosis. Bypass surgery also leads to increased survival in people with diabetes or with multiple or severely blocked coronary arteries."
How do you treat advanced atherosclerosis?,"Narrowed arteries can frequently be reopened with one of two treatments: stenting or bypass surgery. Because these atherosclerosis treatments come with risks, they are typically reserved for emergencies or when medications fail. Which is the better treatment for the late stages of atherosclerosis -- stents or bypass surgery? Sometimes treatment with drugs can't control chronic chest pain."
Why are drug treatments used for essential tremor?,"Topiramate ( Topamax), another drug used to treat epilepsy and migraine, helps some people. With the use of medication, people with essential tremor may see improvement in their ability to control their tremor and improvement in activities such as drinking from a cup or using food utensils. More specialized motor functions, such as being able to thread a needle, may still be too difficult. However, for most people, essential tremor is not disabling. For most people this is not a good long-term solution."
What is Topiramate (Topamax)?,"Topiramate ( Topamax), another drug used to treat epilepsy and migraine, helps some people. It is most useful for people with hand tremor. It is important to start with a very low dose and slowly increase the dose to avoid sleepiness.

But you do need to check for ketones if it's over 250. Your body makes them when it burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. Don't exercise if you have them. If your reading is over 300, ask your doctor if exercise is OK. Otherwise, grab a snack with 15-30 grams of carbs. The lower your blood sugar is before you start and the longer you plan to work out, the larger your snack should be, up to 30 grams of carbs. You'll probably have to try a few options and amounts to see what works best. Check your blood sugar every hour."
Do I need to eat certain things before working out if I have diabetes?,"You'll need to fuel up the right way before, during, and after you work out. If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise."
What should you do if you work out in the morning and have diabetes?,"What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar. Exercising on an empty stomach in the morning can raise it. But food sends a signal to your pancreas to make insulin, which keeps it at a safe level. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise."
How often should I check my blood sugar during a long exercise session?,"What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar. How many carbs your snacks should have depends on how much longer you plan to exercise and what your reading says. The idea is to eat enough carbs to keep you from having a low reading or just plain conking out, but not so many that your levels spike. It may take a few tries to figure out the right balance."
What do my blood sugar levels indicate regarding exercise?,"If your reading is between 200 and 300 mg/dl and you've already eaten at least once that day, you probably don't need to eat anything.

Can birth control pills affect your risk for breast cancer?,"Other studies, however, show no such effect. Most experts believe the low risk at that age doesn't justify the exposure to radiation or the cost of mammography."
What is the best way for younger women to screen for breast cancer?,"But mammograms may be recommended for younger women with a family history of breast cancer and other risk factors. The American Cancer Society ( ACS) recommends that all women know how their breasts look and feel and report any changes to their doctor. The ACS states that research has not shown a clear benefit of performing regular breast self-exams. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of breast self-exam. Regular breast exams done at least every 3 years by your doctor are recommended for women beginning at age 20. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every 2 years from ages 50 through 74 and also that the decision to start yearly screening mammograms before age 50 should be an individual one.. Talk to your doctor about when you should begin to have mammograms. For younger women, digital mammography may be an alternate to a standard mammogram. If you'd like to have children, talk to your doctor it before you begin treatment."
Can young women get breast cancer?,"But it can happen at any age, and it's important to be aware of your risk factors, regardless of your age. Diagnosing breast cancer in women under 40 years old is more difficult, because their breast tissue is generally denser than in older women. Expert groups don't all agree when women should start getting mammograms and you should discuss with your doctor what's right for you."
What medications treat periodic limb movement disorder?,"Many of these are also causes of restless legs syndrome. Benzodiazepines: These drugs suppress muscle contractions. It is probably the most widely used drug to treat PLMD. Dopaminergic agents: These drugs increased the levels of an important neurotransmitter (brain chemical) called dopamine, which is important in regulating muscle movements. These medications seem to improve the condition in some people but not in others. GABA agonists: These agents inhibit release of certain neurotransmitters that stimulate muscle contractions."

It may radiate to your back or abdomen and is more common on your left side. There can be pain with a deep breath or cough. The most common sites of pain are your fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. This pain increases as you move your trunk or take deep breaths. Conversely, it decreases as your movement stops or with quiet breathing. The reproducible tenderness you feel when you press on the rib joints (costochondral junctions) is a constant feature of costochondritis. Without this tenderness, a diagnosis of costochondritis is unlikely. When costochondritis occurs as a result of infection after surgery, you will see redness, swelling, or pus discharge at the site of the surgery."
What problems are associated with costochondritis in adults?,"Chest pain in adults is considered a potentially serious sign of a heart problem by most doctors until proven otherwise. Chest pain in adults usually leads to a battery of tests to rule out heart attack and heart disease. If those tests are normal and your physical exam is consistent with costochondritis, your doctor will diagnose costochondritis as the cause of your chest pain. It is important, however, for adults with chest pain to be examined and tested for heart disease before being diagnosed with costochondritis. It is often difficult to distinguish between the two without further testing. The condition affects females more than males (70% versus 30%). Costochondritis may also occur as the result of an infection or as a complication of surgery on your sternum. Occasionally, costochondritis as a result of bacterial infections can occur in people who use IV drugs or who have had surgery to their upper chest."
What is the follow-up treatment for costochondritis?,"Your doctor will refer you to a surgeon for consultation should this option be considered necessary. Infectious costochondritis responds well to IV antibiotics and surgical repair, but recovery may take a long time."
What should you know about costochondritis?,"Costochondritis is a relatively harmless condition and usually goes away without treatment. The cause is usually unknown, but may happen from increased activity involving the arms. Tietze syndrome is accompanied by a localized swelling at the painful area (the junction of the ribs and breastbone). The diagnosis can only be reached after excluding more serious causes of chest pain that are related to the heart and lungs."
When is surgery needed for costochondritis?,There is no specific test for diagnosing costochondritis. Your doctor will refer you to a surgeon for consultation should this option be considered necessary.
How is endometriosis treated?,"First, your doctor can surgically remove the endometrial tissue.

You'll have a physical exam to check the size, shape, color, and texture of the spot. The dermatologist will also look for other spots on your body and feel your lymph nodes to make sure they aren't bigger or harder than normal. If your doctor thinks a bump looks questionable, he'll remove a sample of the spot (a skin biopsy) to send to a lab for testing. If you've been diagnosed with skin cancer, you're more likely to get it again -- so visit your doctor for regular skin checks."

If you're getting so little that your hands shake, your doctor will give you a shot."
How severe is essential tremor nerve disorder (ET) and can anything be done about it?,"Although Essential Tremor can happen at any age, it's more likely in people over 40. At some point, eating, drinking, writing, and all the other daily tasks you do with your hands can become a bigger challenge. This condition can be hard to treat. Surgery is an option, as is a treatment called deep brain stimulation, in which doctors implant a device in your brain to help control the tremors. If shaky hands are a problem for you, ask your doctor if this might help. Stress: From financial and job worries to relationship problems and health concerns, stress worsens tremors."
What is the most common reason for shaky hands?,"Essential Tremor is the most common tremor disorder. It usually starts in your hands, but it can move to your arms, head, voice, or other body parts. ET is different because it affects your hands when they're already moving. As you live with the disease, the tremor may spread from one side of your body to the other."
What causes essential tremor nerve disorder (ET)?,"It could result from a gene (your doctor may call this a mutation). That means if one of your parents has a tremor, you're more likely to get one, too. Toxins in the environment cause some cases.

A blood test that shows antibodies to HSV-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. That's because oral herpes, typically caused by HSV-1, can be spread to the genitals during oral sex. Studies are under way to investigate medicated gel products that can be placed in the vagina to reduce the transmission of herpes and HIV."
What is the anatomy of a penis?,"The head or glans is at the end of the shaft. The opening at the tip of the head, where urine and semen come out, is called the meatus.

And more than 1 million people visit emergency rooms each year because of ankle injuries. The most common ankle injuries are sprains and fractures, which involve ligaments and bones in the ankle. But you can also tear or strain a tendon. The doctor may order an ankle X-ray to determine whether there are any broken bones."
Are fractures treated surgically or nonsurgically?,"If the sprain is mild, the swelling and pain may be slight. Typically the doctor will do this by putting on a brace that works as a splint or by putting on a cast. If the ankle is unstable, the fracture will be treated surgically. Often, the ankle is made stable by using a metal plate and screws to hold the bones in place. Following the surgery, the ankle is protected with a splint until the swelling goes down and then with a cast."
