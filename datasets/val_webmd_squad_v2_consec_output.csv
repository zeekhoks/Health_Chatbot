Between each one of the vertebra is an intervertebral disk, or band of cartilage serving as a shock absorber between the vertebrae."
What causes back pain?,"Some causes of back pain include accidents, muscle strains, and sports injuries."
What are the types of vertebrae in the backbone?,"The types of vertebrae are: Cervical vertebrae: the seven vertebrae forming the upper part of the spine Thoracic vertebrae: the 12 bones between the neck and the lower back Lumbar vertebrae: the five largest and strongest vertebrae located in the lower back between the chest and hips The sacrum and coccyx are the bones at the base of the spine. The sacrum is made up of five vertebrae fused together, while the coccyx (tailbone) is formed from four fused vertebrae."
How is back pain diagnosed?,"In addition to performing a complete history and physical exam for your back pain, your doctor may suggest one of the following diagnostic studies: X-rays, which can be used to provide detail of the bone structures in the spine and to check for instability (such as spondylolisthesis, see below), tumors, and fractures CT scans, which can identify specific conditions, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis MRI scans, which can provide details about the backs' discs and nerve roots. MRI scans are most commonly used for pre-surgical planning A number of other imaging and electrical studies may also be used to identify back problems, and some injections are used for diagnostic purposes as well as for pain relief."
What are the symptoms of spondylolisthesis?,Symptoms of spondylolithesis may include: Lower back pain Muscle tightness and stiffness Pain in the buttocks Pain radiating down the legs (due to pressure on nerve roots) Muscle weakness Spondylolisthesis is treated with the strengthening of supportive abdominal and back muscles through physical therapy.
What are the causes of cervical radiculopathy?,"In cervical radiculopathy, damage can occur as a result of pressure from material from a ruptured disc, degenerative changes in bones, arthritis, or other injuries that put pressure on the nerve roots. In older people, normal degenerative changes in the discs can cause pressure on nerve roots. In younger people, cervical radiculopathy tends to be the result of a ruptured disc. This disc material then compresses the nerve root, causing pain."
What are the treatments for cervical radiculopathy?,"Cervical radiculopathy may be treated with a combination of pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol), or nonsteroidal pain medication such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen ( Frotek), naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn), and physical therapy. Steroids may be prescribed either orally or injected epidurally (into the epidural space that surrounds the spinal cord). Physical therapy might include gentle cervical traction and mobilization, exercises, and other modalities to reduce pain. If significant compression on the nerve exists to the extent that motor weakness results, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure."
What are seasonal allergies like?,"Common triggers include: Pollen Grass Weeds Dust Pet dander If you have seasonal allergies, you generally have symptoms for a short time.

How can chemotherapy affect your fertility?,"For guys, the reason has to do with the way chemo drugs target fast-growing cancer cells. Since healthy sperm cells divide quickly, chemo can also damage them. If chemo kills the immature stem cells in your testicles that become new sperm, you may become infertile, which means you can't have children. If you're a woman, chemotherapy can damage your eggs and harm your ovaries. You may stop having regular menstrual cycles after treatment. Many women who have chemo go through menopause at an earlier age than usual. For both men and women, chemotherapy's effect on fertility depends on a number of things, including the type of drugs you used and the dose.

How is saliva produced?,"The harder you chew, the more saliva you make. Sucking on a hard candy or cough drop helps you make saliva, too. The glands that make saliva are called salivary glands. The salivary glands sit inside each cheek, at the bottom of your mouth, and near your front teeth by the jaw bone. There are six major salivary glands and hundreds of minor ones. Saliva moves through tubes called salivary ducts. Normally, the body makes up to 2 to 4 pints of saliva a day. Usually, the body makes the most saliva in the late afternoon. It makes the least amount at night. But everyone is different. What doctors consider to be a normal amount of saliva varies quite a bit. That makes diagnosing saliva problems a bit of a challenge."

Do I have to use the buckle on my baby's high chair?,"That's a serious milestone, but you'll need to follow these safety rules: Always buckle a baby into his chair for safety, even if he is unable to get out with the tray in place. As he gets older and becomes more active, he may be able to squirm out. It is a good habit to buckle a child as soon as you place him in his chair -- even if you think there's no chance he could fall out or climb out. You may get distracted for a moment, which happens really easily when we are trying to do a million things at once!"
Does my baby need to drink water?,"Babies don't need water during their first 6 months of life. They get all the water they need from breast milk or baby formula. Babies under age 6 months should not be given any water at all, because it's easy to fill up their tiny stomachs -- and they should be filling up on the nutrients they receive from the milk to grow. Once they start eating mostly solid foods, around age 9 months, they can start water with meals using a sippy cup."
Does pregnancy affect irritable bowel syndrome?,"Hormone levels rise when you're expecting, so your IBS symptoms may improve. Some research shows that you're able to handle more pain during pregnancy. This could mean you have fewer cramps and less discomfort. But moms-to-be also tend get constipated more often."
How do sex hormones affect irritable bowel syndrome?,"Estrogen and progesterone affect IBS symptoms in a few ways, from how your intestines work to how much pain you feel. Cells in your gut have things called receptors that let these hormones latch on to them. This suggests that your digestive system is designed to sense and react to them. Here are the main ways they affect IBS: Digestion: They control the smooth muscle in your intestines, which dictates how quickly food travels through your system. In one study, animals took longer to empty their intestines when they received a low dose of the hormones than when they got a higher one. This may explain why low levels of sex hormones can lead to constipation. Pain level: These hormones affect how much your cramps bother you. A dip lowers your pain threshold, in part because estrogen boosts the production of serotonin, a feel-good chemical in your brain. A jump in estrogen can reduce some of the ouch factor, so your bellyaches or cramps don't hurt as much. Inflammation: Sex hormones can raise levels of inflammation throughout your body. That makes your IBS symptoms worse. Most research has linked estrogen and progesterone with IBS. But scientists have also found that male sex hormones, like testosterone, may protect against the condition. This may be partly why men are less likely to get the disorder."

What is the final word on the Glycemic Index Diet?,"The Final Word The glycemic index diet was developed to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar, and that's what it's best for. For those with diabetes or prediabetes, this diet is an important piece in the big picture of taking charge of the food you eat and staying healthy and active."
How does the Glycemic Index Diet work?,"Sticking to a low glycemic index diet may help prevent conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it's not certain that this diet can help you lose weight any better or faster than a low-fat, low-carb, generally healthy diet. One study showed that people on a low-glycemic diet lost more fat than those on a high-glycemic diet with the same calories. Overall, the scientific evidence is mixed and unable to show consistent findings."
What happens when a person is quarantined?,"During quarantine people are able to do most things they can do indoors within the constraints of the location they are at.

Are drugs the only option for treating nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy?,"A few other types of drugs can also help: Anti-anxiety drugs: alprazolam ( Niravam, Xanax), diazepam ( Valium), and lorazepam ( Ativan) Cannabinoids: abilone ( Cesamet)dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) Corticosteroids: dexamethasone ( Decadron, Hexadrol)methylprednisolone ( Medrol) Dopamine antagonists: metoclopramide ( Reglan)prochlorperazine Motion sickness medicines: scopolamine patch ( Transderm Scop) Drugs aren't the only option. You might try a complementary therapy -- a type of treatment that's outside traditional medicine but can be used along with it to ease your symptoms."
Can nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy be prevented?,"In the past, people who got chemo had to live with the intense nausea and vomiting. That's no longer true. Today, doctors have many drugs to stop -- and even prevent -- them."
Why does chemotherapy make you sick?,"Your body sees the medicine as foreign. It sets off warning signals in your brain and digestive system.

What is the difference between heart failure and a heart attack?,"They have some common causes. But they also differ in key ways. Most heart attacks happen suddenly when one of the arteries leading to the heart becomes blocked and cuts off the blood flow. Without oxygen, the heart muscles start to die. Heart failure, on the other hand, usually develops gradually. The heart muscle becomes weaker and has trouble pumping blood to nourish the cells in your body. This is a chronic condition that gradually gets worse. But medications can help you live longer and better with it. Heart attacks can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart's pumping ability. Sometimes, heart failure comes on suddenly after a heart attack. Usually the symptoms are severe at first. This is called acute heart failure. But you can get better quickly with treatment and medication. Coronary artery disease is at the root of both heart attack and heart failure."
How can you treat heart attacks?,"If you have heart failure, you'll likely notice more than one of these classic symptoms: Shortness of breath (especially when lying down) Wheezing or coughing Fast or irregular heartbeat Tiredness Swelling around your ankles, legs, or stomach and weight gain from retaining fluid Confusion Heart attacks need to be treated right away. Call 911 even if you only suspect you're having one. Paramedics will probably give you blood-thinning aspirin to prevent any more clots and nitroglycerin to help blood flow. Your long-term treatment will depend on the cause, but many people recover well from a heart attack. You may need a procedure to open the blocked artery. With percutaneous coronary intervention, a surgeon threads a tube into the blocked artery. Then she expands a tiny balloon attached to the end of the tube to open the artery. At the same time, she may put a tiny mesh tube called a stent in to keep the artery propped open. Your doctor could suggest coronary artery bypass grafting. The surgeon takes out a healthy blood vessel and attaches it to the damaged vessel to create a detour for the blood. Your doctor will probably prescribe some long-term medications. They include drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. She may also suggest you learn how to manage your underlying heart disease through diet and exercise."

What causes blood in urine (hematuria)?,"Common causes of blood in urine include: Bladder or kidney infections Bladder or kidney stones Certain kidney diseases, such as inflammation in the filtering system of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis) Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) or prostate cancer Inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia and cystic kidney disease Certain medications such as aspirin, penicillin, heparin, cyclophosphamide, and phenazopyridine A tumor in the bladder, kidney, or prostate Kidney injury from an accident or sports Vigorous exercise Sometimes, what appears to be blood in urine is actually red pigment from other sources such as food dyes, medications, or an excessive amount of beets."
How is blood in urine (hematuria) assessed?,"Your doctor will start by taking a medical history and asking what may have caused the appearance of blood in your urine. This will be followed by a test called urinalysis. In this test, a urine sample is analyzed. Urine tests may include urine cytology, which uses a microscope to look for abnormal cells in the urine. Blood tests may also be ordered. If blood contains high levels of wastes that kidneys are supposed to remove, it could be a sign of kidney disease."
What is the treatment for blood in urine (hematuria) aimed at?,"Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause. After treatment, your doctor will recheck your urine to see if the blood is gone. If you still have blood in your urine, you may need additional tests, or you may be referred to a urologist. Usually, no treatment is necessary unless a serious condition is causing the hematuria. If no underlying cause is found during the initial evaluation, you may be advised to have follow-up urine testing and blood pressure monitoring every three to six months, especially if you have risk factors for bladder cancer, such as being age 50 or older, smoking cigarettes, or exposure to certain industrial chemicals."
What symptoms come with blood in urine (hematuria)?,"It also can come from other structures in the urinary tract, such as: Ureters (the tubes from the kidneys to the bladder) Bladder (where urine is stored) Urethra (the tube from the bladder to the outside of the body) If there is blood in urine, the symptom is obvious. Instead of its normal pale yellow color, your urine may be pink, red, brownish-red, or tea-colored. This is what doctors call gross hematuria. Sometimes, blood in urine is not visible to the naked eye and the presence of red blood cells can only be detected by the lab. This is what doctors call microscopic hematuria. It's usually only discovered when a urine sample is tested with a dipstick and the results are confirmed with a microscopic examination."
What other symptoms may occur with blood in urine (hematuria)?,"Some underlying causes, however, are associated with additional symptoms that can be moderate to severe. These include: Bladder infections (acute cystitis). In adults, bladder infections usually cause burning or pain with urination.

Can you put weight on ankle after it has been injured,"It is important not to put any weight on the ankle until after it's been evaluated by a doctor, which should be done as soon as possible. Fractures and sprains that are ignored or aren't treated properly can lead to long-term chronic problems with the ankle, such as repeated injury, ankle weakness, and arthritis."
What is an ankle fracture versus an ankle sprain?,A fracture describes a break in one or more of the bones. A sprain is the term that describes damage to ligaments when they are stretched beyond their normal range of motion. A ligament sprain can range from many microscopic tears in the fibers that comprise the ligament to a complete tear or rupture. A strain refers to damage to muscles and tendons as a result of being pulled or stretched too far.
What are ankle injuries?,"Sprains, Strains, and Fractures Ankle injuries are defined by the kind of tissue -- bone, ligament, or tendon -- that's damaged. The ankle is where three bones meet -- the tibia and fibula of your lower leg with the talus of your foot. These bones are held together at the ankle joint by ligaments, which are strong elastic bands of connective tissue that keep the bones in place while allowing normal ankle motion. Tendons attach muscles to the bones to do the work of making the ankle and foot move, and help keep the joints stable."
What does the overall treatment process of an ankle sprain look like?,"On average, the initial treatment of a sprain, includes resting, and protecting the ankle until swelling goes down for about one week. That's followed by a period of one to two weeks of exercise to restore range of motion, strength, and flexibility. It can take several more weeks to several months to gradually return to your normal activities while you continue to exercise."

How can I tell the difference between a migraine and a stroke?,"It can be hard to tell the difference between a migraine with aura and a TIA. Here's what to look for: With a stroke, symptoms usually come on suddenly. With a migraine, they happen gradually; the headache usually starts small and gets more painful. A stroke is more likely to have what are called ""negative"" symptoms such as you might lose sight in one eye or lose feeling in one of your hands or feet. A migraine is more likely to have ""positive"" symptoms. That means added sensations, like flashes in your vision or tingling in your skin. If you're young, it's more likely to be a migraine. If you're older, it's more likely to be a stroke, especially if you've never had a migraine before or you have high blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat."
What are the causes of a stroke?,"There can be two causes. Either a blood vessel is blocked, for instance with a blood clot, or a blood vessel tears or bursts and causes bleeding in or around the brain."

When should you assume your migraine could be stroke?,"If you're over 40 and have never had a migraine, assume your pain is something more serious. People who get migraine typically have it most of their lives. It's rare to have your first symptoms when you're older.

Why do people take ashwagandha?,"However, the practical benefits and risks for people aren't clear yet. One study found that a compound containing ashwagandha helped relive osteoarthritis symptoms. It's not clear which of the ingredients had the benefit since ashwaganda is traditionally used in combination with other herbs. Ashwagandha might help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes and lower high cholesterol. Since ashwagandha has sedative effects, it could help ease anxiety and stress -- in fact, human studies have indicated as much."

What is a shoulder SLAP tear?,"They work together in a ball-and-socket joint where the arm connects to your trunk. Your shoulder's labrum isn't a bone. It's soft tissue that helps connect the socket part of the scapula (called the glenoid) with the head of the humerus. If the labrum tears, there's not enough cushion between those bones. You also have a labrum in your hip sockets, which also acts like a connective cushion."

How can you drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Constant drainage is best during the first 3 to 4 weeks for a new pouch. If the catheter or tube accidentally falls out before that time, you can put it back in with these simple steps: Relax your abdominal muscles. It may be helpful to bend your knee as you do that. Relubricate the catheter with water-soluble lubricant. Don't use Vaseline or other products containing petroleum jelly. Reinsert the catheter up to the preset mark. If you find this hard to do, relax, change positions and try again. During this initial period, you will need to irrigate the catheter several times a day with 1 ounce of tap water and let it drain off."
How do you irrigate the catheter in a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Separate the catheter from the drainage bag and drain the contents of the catheter into the basin. Collect 1 ounce of tap water into the bulb syringe. Tip: Mark this spot on the bulb syringe with permanent marker or nail polish for accurate, easy measurement. To insert the ounce of tap water into the catheter, slowly squeeze the bulb syringe to release the water. While you hold the syringe bulb down with your thumb, pinch the catheter and separate the bulb syringe from the catheter. Unpinch the catheter and drain its contents into the basin. Don't withdraw the fluid from the catheter into the syringe. If the fluid you just put in seems to take a long time to come back out, or if mucus blocks the catheter, irrigate again as needed until stool flows freely through the catheter. If water doesn't go in or come back out, the tube may be blocked. You may have to remove the catheter from the stoma and rinse it with cool tap water to clean any mucus built up inside the catheter. Then reinsert the catheter. Don't put in more than 2 ounces of water without the pouch contents emptying. When the stool flow has stopped, reconnect the catheter. Cleanse the skin around it and the stoma. Use a non-oily soap and warm water to do that. Rinse, and pat dry with a soft towel or paper towel. Put two layers of ""split"" dry gauze dressing around the catheter and over the stoma. Secure with tape as needed. Throw out the trash. Wash the basin and the bulb syringe with soap and warm water. Let the supplies air dry, or dry with a clean towel. Wash, rinse, and dry your hands."
What is a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Unlike other ileostomies, the K-pouch has a valve that the surgeon makes. She sews the intestine in a special way so that waste material doesn't leak out. Instead, you insert a tube called a catheter when it's time to empty the pouch. As the pouch fills with what's in your intestines (such as liquids and partly digested food), pressure builds up on the pouch and its many stitches. Without relief, the pouch could tear or develop a hole, or the valve could slip or leak."
How should you drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy) after the first few weeks?,"After the first 3 to 4 weeks, you can stop the continuous draining and start draining several times per day, or as instructed by your health care provider. Though you usually make this change after seeing your doctor for the first time after the operation, sometimes your doctor will tell you to start doing the following earlier: Drain the pouch every 2 hours during the day while you are awake. Drain at bedtime and first thing in the morning. Don't drink or eat within 2 hours of bedtime. During the night, you will usually set the catheter to constant drainage. You may also set your alarm clock to wake you to empty the pouch."
What are other helpful tips about K-pouch (continent ileostomy) care?,"Check the catheter often to be sure drainage flows freely through the tube. Irrigate it twice a day, or as instructed by your ET nurse or doctor. You should also inspect your stoma daily. It should look shiny, moist, and red. If you see any changes, tell your doctor. If your stool becomes too thick and movement through the catheter slows down or has problems, you may need to drink more water, juice, or other beverages that don't have caffeine. Go for 10-12 glasses -- 8 ounces each -- per day. Never take laxative preparations. They can cause diarrhea and lead to dehydration."
How should you drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy) after three months?,"Three months after surgery, there are usually no specific restrictions. You'll probably need to empty the pouch four to six times per day and use irrigation two of these times. But anytime you feel full or bloated, drain the pouch. And do it before you work out or go to bed."
How often do I drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Right after the operation, you will have what doctors call an indwelling catheter, meaning the surgeon will leave a tube in the pouch to drain continuously. This will last for about 3 to 4 weeks to allow the pouch to mature. After that, you will drain the pouch several times per day. The number of times you need to drain the pouch each day becomes less over time. Talk with your doctor, surgeon, or enterostomal therapist ( ET), a nurse who specializes in the care of stomas. Most likely, you will have met them before the operation. They can remind you of how to take care of your stoma, ostomy, or pouch."

What causes colon polyps?,"Doctors don't know exactly why they form. Normally, healthy cells grow and divide in a specific way. Polyps may happen when cells grow and divide more than they should. Anyone can get colon polyps, but certain things make you more likely to have them, including if you: Are overweight or obese Are age 50 or older Smoke Have had colon polyps or colon cancer before Have an inflammatory bowel disease, like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Have type 2 diabetes that isn't well-controlled There are also some genetic conditions that raise your chances for polyps and colon cancer, including: Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP)."
How can you prevent colon polyps?,"Healthy habits can lower your odds of having colon polyps. For example, you should: Eat a diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and fiber-rich foods like beans, lentils, peas, and high-fiber cereal. Lose weight if you're overweight. Limit red meat, processed meats, and foods that are high in fat. Talk to your doctor about whether calcium and vitamin D supplements are right for you. Some studies suggest they could lower your odds of colon cancer, but others don't. If you have a family history of colon polyps, ask your doctor if you should get genetic counseling and when you should start screening for polyps."
What is primary biliary cholangitis?,"Primary biliary cholangiitis is a disease damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis. These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need."
How do decongestants work?,"They help reduce swelling in the passageways of your nose, which relieves the feeling of pressure and improves the flow of air. You'll be able to breathe a whole lot better. Decongestants come in pill form or nasal sprays. Don't use the sprays for more than 3 days, or you may get more stuffed up."
What medicines are used for congestion?,"Decongestants and antihistamines can help. They come in different forms, and they're often mixed into combination drugs that you can buy without a prescription. It pays to do a little homework to make sure you're picking the right medicine for your symptoms."
What are the side effects of decongestants?,"Decongestants may keep you awake and are usually taken during the day. Nasal sprays are less likely to have that side effect and may be helpful at night for congestion. Decongestants can also raise blood pressure. So if your BP is high already, or you've got heart disease, check with your doctor before you use them."
What are the most common areas for pain from sickle cell disease?,You may have pain anywhere in your body and in more than one place. The most common areas are: Arms Belly Chest Legs Lower back A pain crisis can last anywhere from hours to weeks.
What is the definition of hypnosis?,"Hypnosis is defined as an altered state of awareness in which you appear to be asleep or in a trance. Clinical hypnosis may be used to treat certain physical or psychological problems. For instance, it is frequently used to help patients control pain. It is also used in a wide range of other conditions such as weight issues, speech disorders, and addiction problems."
How well does hypnosis work to help people stop smoking?,"Study results have been mixed. In 2010, a systematic review of published studies found that there wasn't enough evidence to support the use of hypnosis."
What is Spiegel's method of hypnosis for quitting smoking?,"Spiegel's method is one popular smoking cessation hypnosis technique that focuses on three main ideas: Smoking poisons the body You need your body to live You should respect your body and protect it (to the extent you'd like to live) The hypnotherapist teaches the smoker self-hypnosis, and then asks him or her to repeat these affirmations anytime the desire to smoke occurs."
How successful is hypnosis for smoking cessation?,"Hypnosis, in general, does not work for everyone. About one in four people are not able to be hypnotized. When successful, the intensity of hypnosis can vary from person to person."
What are symptoms of leukemia?,"Many types of leukemia produce no obvious symptoms in the early stages. Eventually, symptoms may include any of the following: Anemia and related symptoms, such as fatigue, pallor, and a general feeling of illness. A tendency to bruise or bleed easily, including bleeding from the gums or nose, or blood in the stool or urine. Susceptibility to infections such as sore throat or bronchial pneumonia, which may be accompanied by headache, low-grade fever, mouth sores, or skin rash. Swollen lymph nodes, typically in the throat, armpits, or groin. Loss of appetite and weight. Discomfort under the left lower ribs (caused by a swollen spleen). Very high white blood cell counts may result in visual problems due to retinal hemorrhage, ringing of the ears (tinnitus), mental status changes, prolonged erection (priapism), and stroke."
What is intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET)?,"Intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae. Sometimes the discs can become damaged and cause pain. IDET uses heat to modify the nerve fibers of a spinal disc and to destroy pain receptors in the area. In this procedure, a wire called an electrothermal catheter is placed through an incision in the disc. An electrical current passes through the wire, heating a small outer portion of the disc to a temperature of 90 degrees Celsius. IDET is performed as an outpatient procedure while the patient is awake and under a local anesthesia."
What is radiofrequency discal nucleoplasty?,"Radiofrequency discal nucleoplasty is a newer procedure which utilizes a radio frequency probe instead of heating wire to disintegrate a small portion of the central disc material. The result of this intervention is partial decompression of the disc, which may help relieve pain caused by bulging discs pressing on nearby spinal nerve roots."
What is melanoma like in people with dark skin?,"Although dark-skinned people have a natural protection against skin cancer, that doesn't mean it can't occur. It does -- most frequently where skin is lightest, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and around the nail bed. This is most true for Asians, Native Americans, and people of African descent. In Hispanics, melanoma occurs most frequently on the legs. Because it is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), tinea manuum (a fungus occurring on the palms of the hands), or a condition known as talon noir or black heel, and because many people do not seek treatment early on, the melanoma death rate is highest among people with dark skin. The lifesaving answer lies in awareness and early diagnosis."
What should you know about skin conditions in dark skin?,"Skin problems, however, are generally color-blind, meaning that most skin conditions can occur in every race and in all skin types. That said, there are certain skin conditions that seem to affect dark skin more frequently or with more severity. Further, many treatments used for common skin conditions can sometimes lead to even more problems when used on people of color. But before you can learn how to protect your face and body, it's important to know a little something about the biology of dark skin."
What is pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) like for people with dark skin?,"This skin condition is characterized by bumps under the surface of the skin, and is often confused with acne. But the problem actually stems from ingrown hairs. It most often occurs in black and Hispanic people, due to the distinct shape of the hair follicle. If the bumps are squeezed or manipulated in any way, they can become inflamed or infected. But even when left alone, they can be difficult to cover and sometimes cause pain. Recent studies have shown that laser hair removal is an effective treatment. Because this condition is often confused with acne, it's important to have your diagnosis confirmed by a dermatologist familiar with dark skin."
Who is at greatest risk for pigmentation problems?,"Those with sensitive skin are at greatest risk for pigmentation problems. In fact, any skin care product ingredient that irritates or dries skin increases the risk."
How is gestational diabetes treated?,"Do urine tests that check for ketones, which mean that your diabetes is not under control Eat a healthy diet that's in line with your doctor's recommendations Make exercise a habit Your doctor will track how much weight you gain and let you know if you need to take insulin or other medicine for your gestational diabetes."
Who is more likely to get gestational diabetes?,"You are more likely to get gestational diabetes if you: Were overweight before you got pregnant Are African- American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American Have high blood sugar levels, but not high enough to be diabetes Have a family history of diabetes Have had gestational diabetes before Have high blood pressure or other medical complications Have given birth to a large baby before (greater than 9 pounds) Have given birth to a baby that was stillborn or had certain birth defects Are older than 25 Gestational diabetes usually happens in the second half of pregnancy."
What do I need to know about using a surrogate mother?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } There's still some controversy about using a surrogate mother to have a baby. The legal process is also tricky because it varies from state to state. Even so, whether it's because of fertility problems or other reasons, surrogacy is an option for you and your partner. Find out how it works and see if it's right for you."
How can I choose a surrogate mother?,"Right now there aren't any regulations about who can be a surrogate mother. But experts agree on a few points about how to select one. You should choose a surrogate who: Is at least 21 years old Has already given birth to at least one healthy baby so she understands firsthand the medical risks of pregnancy and childbirth and the emotional issues of bonding with a newborn Has passed a psychological screening by a mental health professional to uncover any issues with giving up the baby after birth Signs a contract about her role and responsibilities in the pregnancy, such as prenatal care and agreeing to give you the baby after birth The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says a surrogate should get a medical exam to check that she's likely to have a healthy, full-term pregnancy."

The organization suggests she gets tests that check for infectious diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C. Surrogates should get tests to make sure they have immunity to measles, rubella ( German measles), and chickenpox. Also, you may want to ask that she get a medical procedure to visually ""map"" the uterus, which can help the doctor check her potential to carry a pregnancy. A surrogate mother should have her own doctor during pregnancy rather than use yours. The cost of surrogacy can range from $80,000 to $120,000. A lot of different things go into the price, such as whether the surrogate has her own medical insurance or whether you need to buy a surrogacy-pregnancy policy for her."
Who uses surrogates?,"If you're a woman, you may consider a surrogate for several reasons: Medical problems with your uterus You had a hysterectomy that removed your uterus Conditions that make pregnancy impossible or risky for you, such as severe heart disease You may want to think about surrogacy if you tried but couldn't get pregnant with a variety of assisted-reproduction techniques, such as IVF. Surrogates have also made parenthood an option for people who might not be able to adopt a child, perhaps because of their age or marital status. If gay men decide to use a traditional surrogate, one of them uses his sperm to fertilize the surrogate's egg through artificial insemination. The surrogate then carries the baby and gives birth. A gay couple might also choose an egg donor, fertilize that donated egg, and then have the embryo implanted in a gestational surrogate to carry until birth."
What medications treat Parkinson's disease?,Selegiline ( Eldepryl Zelapar) and rasagiline ( Azilect).
How does safinamide help with Parkinson's disease?,"Safinamide ( Xadago) is an add-on medicine that may be prescribed when individuals taking levdopoa and carbidopa have a breakthrough of Parkinson's symptoms that were previously under control. Studies show that adding this drug helps individuals experience longer times with reduced or no symptoms. The most common side effects are trouble falling or staying asleep, nausea, falls, and uncontrolled, involuntary movements."
How do dopamine agonists help with Parkinson's disease?,"They include ropinirole ( Requip), pramipexole ( Mirapex), and rotigotine ( Neupro). You can take one of these drugs on its own or along with Sinemet. Most doctors prescribe dopamine agonists first and then add levodopa if your symptoms still aren't under control. Dopamine agonists don't have the same risks of long-term problems as levodopa therapy."
How does Sinemet help with Parkinson's disease?,"Sinemet is a mix of levodopa and another drug called carbidopa. Carbidopa makes the levodopa work better, so you can take less of it. That prevents many common side effects of levodopa, such as nausea, vomiting, and irregular heart rhythms. Sinemet has the fewest short-term side effects, compared with other Parkinson's medications. But it does raise your odds for some long-term problems, such as involuntary movements."
Which drugs stop the breakdown of dopamine to treat Parkinson's disease?,"These drugs block the brain chemicals that break down dopamine. That helps your brain have more dopamine to work with. Some evidence shows that selegiline may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, especially early on."
When should you try a different opioid to avoid constipation?,"These meds work by blocking the effects that the drugs have on your gut: Lubiprostone ( Amitzia), a pill Methylnaltrexone ( Relistor), a shot Naldemedine ( Symproic), a pill Naloxegol ( Movantik), a pill All opioids can cause constipation, but some may have less of an effect than others. Some studies have found that fentanyl may cause less constipation than morphine. Tapentadol may also be easier on your intestines than oxycodone. Methadone may also be less constipating. Talk to your doctor about which drugs will give you the right balance of pain relief and fewer side effects."
What are prescription options to treat guttate psoriasis?,"There are several over-the-counter or prescription options for the itchy, flaky skin, as well as the dryness and swelling. They include: Cortisone cream for itching and swelling Dandruff shampoo for your scalp Lotions with coal tar to soothe your skin Moisturizers Prescription medicines with or vitamin AIf your case is more serious, your doctor may give you a prescription to take by mouth."
What causes guttate psoriasis?,"An outbreak is usually triggered by a bacterial infection -- typically streptococcus (strep throat). It sets off an immune system reaction that causes the spots on your skin. In some cases, guttate psoriasis is genetic. If someone in your family has it, your chances of getting it go up."
What  does dimethylaminoethanol do in skin care products?,The brain makes DMAE. DMAE in skin care products shows minimal effects at best when applied on skin for the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.
What is kojic acid?,"Kojic acid is a more recent remedy for treating pigment problems and age spots. First developed in 1989, kojic acid has a similar effect as hydroquinone. Kojic acid is made from a fungus, and studies have shown that it is effective at lightening skin."
What is retinol?,"Kojic acid is made from a fungus, and studies have shown that it is effective at lightening skin. Retinol is made from vitamin A, and it's in many non-prescription skin care products. Retinol's stronger counterpart is tretinoin, which is the active ingredient in Retin- A and Renova, available by prescription only."
What are alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs)?,"Creams and lotions with alpha-hydroxy acids may help with fine lines, irregular pigmentation, and age spots. Side effects of alpha-hydroxy acids include mild irritation and sun sensitivity. For that reason, sunscreen should be used every morning."
What does alpha-lipoic acid do in skin care products?,"Alpha-lipoic acid diminishes fine lines, gives skin a healthy glow, and boosts levels of other antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Alpha-lipoic acid can enter all parts of a skin cell. Due to this quality, it is believed that alpha-lipoic acid can provide more protection than other antioxidants against so-called free radicals that can damage skin."
What are calcium channel blockers?,"Heart conditions that calcium channel blockers might be prescribed for: High blood pressure (especially in African Americans) Coronary artery disease Coronary spasm Angina (chest pain) Abnormal heart rhythms Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diastolic heart failure (preserved left ventricular function) Raynaud's syndrome (a circulatory problem affecting blood vessels in the hands and feet) Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of your lungs) If you have systolic heart failure, then amlodipine and felodipine are the only calcium channel blockers you should use."
What should I avoid when I'm taking calcium channel blockers?,"Contact your doctor right away if you: Gain weight Have trouble breathing (shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing) Get a skin rash or hives Are very lightheaded or faint Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you're taking a calcium channel blocker. Avoid alcohol because it can change how calcium channel blockers work and make the side effects worse. Your doctor needs to know about all the medications you're taking, to avoid problems with calcium channel blockers. Talk to your doctor before you take anything new, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements."
What side effects of calcium channel blockers should I immediately contact my doctor for?,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) Tenderness or bleeding of the gums Sexual dysfunction Let your doctor know if these side effects are severe or don't go away. Contact your doctor right away if you: Gain weight Have trouble breathing (shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing) Get a skin rash or hives Are very lightheaded or faint Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you're taking a calcium channel blocker."
Are calcium channel blockers safe to use during pregnancy?,"However, you should always consult with your doctor before taking calcium channel blockers during pregnancy.

What are the different types of ear drops?,"For the most part, there are three main types of eye drops: Artificial tears Allergy drops Anti-redness drops Some eye drops might do a combination of things, but if you understand these basic types, you'll know how to choose wisely. You might also notice some natural, homeopathic, or herbal eye drops. Generally, there's just not a lot of evidence about how well these really work."
Why should you watch out for preservatives in artificial tears relative to eye drops?,"Artificial tears with them can be great because they're often cheaper. But for some people, they can make dry eyes worse. Some people are allergic to preservatives, and others may find that they irritate their eyes."
What's in allergy eye drops?,"The key ingredient in allergy eye drops is a drug called an antihistamine, which blocks histamines from doing their work and prevents allergy symptoms. Some newer allergy eye drops, called mast-cell stabilizers, work by stopping your body from making histamines in the first place."
How can I find preservative-free eye drops?,"When you're looking for preservative-free eye drops, note that they don't come in the typical eye drop bottle. You usually find them in single-use vials instead. You snap the lid off, put the drops in, and throw out the vial. They also tend to be more expensive than other kinds."
When should I use anti-redness drops for my eyes?,"But use with caution. If you put them in for more than a few days, they can irritate your eyes and make the redness even worse. Another problem: If you use them often, your eyes get dependent on them and may get red when you stop using them. Avoid these drops if you have dry eyes. Sometimes, anti-redness drops also have antihistamines in them, which can relieve itchiness from allergies. But again, you're limited in how much you can use them without bothering your eyes. You're typically better off with allergy drops."
What are symptoms of athlete's foot?,"But with any kind you have, you'll probably see: Itchy, scaly red rash between your toes Small, red blisters (usually on your soles or between your toes) Ongoing dryness and scaling on the soles and up the sides of your foot Ulcers or sores that leak fluid, smell bad, and look red The fungus that causes ringworm and jock itch is usually the one to blame for athlete's foot."
What is treatment for athlete's foot?,"You should treat athlete's foot as soon as you notice even minor symptoms. It's fine to try over-the-counter products, or you may have a home remedy you like to use. But sometimes they don't work, and that's when you need to make an appointment with your doctor."
How is a heart transplant used to treat heart failure?,This device is similar to a pacemaker.
What should your diet consist of to help with heart failure?,"Limit the salt you eat to less than 1,500 milligrams each day. Eat foods high in fiber and potassium. Cut back on things high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar. If you need to drop some weight, reduce the number of calories you eat."
How is heart failure treated?,"If you have heart failure, you have a lot of choices for treatment. Your doctor may suggest you start with medication and lifestyle changes. If your condition gets worse, you can turn to centers that specialize in treating heart failure for more options, like surgery."
How is infarct exclusion surgery (modified Dor or Dor procedure) used to treat heart failure?,"When a heart attack happens in the left ventricle (the lower left chamber of your heart), a scar forms. The scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat, forming what's called an aneurysm. A heart surgeon can remove it."

How can diabetes affect my oral health?,"The good news: Good habits will help keep your mouth healthy. Diabetes can make you more likely to have cavities and fungal infections. Other potential problems include: Difficulty fighting off infections, including those that might lead to gum disease Slower healing time after dental surgery Dry mouth, called xerostomia, is common among people with diabetes. Saliva is important to oral health -- it helps wash away food particles and keep the mouth moist. When you don't produce enough moisture, bacteria thrive, tissues can get irritated and inflamed, and your teeth can be more prone to decay."
What are facts about chronic fatigue syndrome and who does it affect most?,"The CDC estimates up to 2.5 million Americans have ME/ CFS. Anyone can get it, including children and teens. It is most common in women in their 40s and 50s. Women are more likely to develop it than men. Most cases are mild or moderate. About 1 in 4 people with the condition have severe symptoms."
How can you find out if you have chronic fatigue syndrome?,"The National Academy of Medicine has issued guidelines describing the combination of symptoms necessary for doctors to diagnose the condition. Unfortunately, there is not yet a diagnostic test that is sufficiently accurate to be useful. Because extreme fatigue is a symptom of so many conditions, your doctor will want to rule out other conditions first, before considering a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. You'll need to get a complete checkup and talk with your doctor about all your symptoms."
Can serotonin and cortisol levels contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome?,"Serotonin and cortisol: Several studies indicate that serotonin, a major brain chemical, is important in the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. People with the illness have low levels of cortisol, a hormone that the body releases in response to stress."
What else is chronic fatigue syndrome known as and is it curable?,"Chronic fatigue syndrome is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME/ CFS). It tends to cycle through flareups and remissions, good days and bad days, although on the good days you are not back to normal. There isn't any known cure, but different treatments can help the symptoms."
Could infections or other illnesses contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome?,"Infections or other illness: Chronic fatigue syndrome often, but not always, begins with a sudden infectious-like illness (fever, sore throat, aching muscles, upset stomach). Research has found that several different types of infectious agents can trigger the beginning of the illness, including Epstein- Barr virus (a common cause of mononucleosis), Lyme disease bacteria and Q fever bacteria."
What are dental implants?,Dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.

Many are minor, some are just an inconvenience, a few are serious, and some are just plain strange. Perhaps the most common set of side effects for drugs that work inside your body involves the gastrointestinal system. Nearly any drug can cause nausea or an upset stomach, though it may only happen to a handful of people. For drugs used on the outside, skin irritation is a common complaint."
What is the FDA's role in side effects of drugs?,"Before a drug can come on the market, the FDA must approve it. The New Drug Applications ( NDAs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies have, first and foremost, evidence that the drug has the effect it's supposed to have and is safe. This proof comes from testing the drug, first in animals and then in humans. Once the basic questions of safety and efficacy are settled, the FDA will approve the drug if it deems that its benefits outweigh its risks. Still, sometimes testing doesn't reveal everything about a drug's side effects, and they don't show up until after the medication enters the marketplace and more people start using it. That's where Med Watch comes in. The FDA's post-marketing surveillance program seeks voluntary input, mainly from health care professionals, on unwanted effects they see in ''the real world.'' Sometimes these reports are numerous or serious enough for the FDA to take regulatory action, such as adding warnings to a drug's label. This happened with the psoriasis drug Raptiva. The FDA required that the drug carry the agency's strongest warning, known as a black box warning, after it received reports of brain infections and meningitis in patients taking the drug. The drug was later taken off the market. The FDA also wants input from consumers when it comes to side effects. All prescription drugs, and many OTC products, must be labeled with a toll-free number the agency has for letting it know about side effects with drugs, called ""adverse events."" You can report possible new but severe side effects through Med Watch at 1-800- FDA-1088 or through the FDA website."

Changing sleep positions to improve breathing. Stopping smoking. Smoking can increase the swelling in the upper airway, which may worsen both snoring and apnea. Avoiding sleeping on your back."
What are the types of surgery for sleep apnea?,"If you have a deviated nasal septum, enlarged tonsils, or a small lower jaw with an overbite causing the throat to be too narrow, surgery may be needed to correct sleep apnea. The most commonly performed types of surgery for sleep apnea include: Nasal surgery: Correction of nasal problems such as a deviated septum. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ( UPPP): A procedure that removes soft tissue on the back of the throat and palate, increasing the width of the airway at the opening of throat. Mandibular maxillomandibular advancement surgery: Surgery to correct certain facial problems or throat obstructions that contribute to sleep apnea."
How helpful iares dental devices in treating sleep apnea?,Dental devices can be made that help keep the airway open during sleep. Such devices can be specifically designed by dentists with special expertise in treating sleep apnea.
What are the treatments options for sleep apnea?,"Sleep apnea treatments range from lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing sleep positions, to CPAP therapy, to surgery."
What can help you remove germs from your kitchen sponge?,"Washing a sponge in the dishwasher also isn't enough to kill germs unless you have an extremely high-heat germicide cycle. As an alternative, you can use paper towels or a clean cloth; be sure to use the cloth only once and then toss it in the laundry. If you do use sponges, you can soak them between cleanings in a solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water, or vinegar and water. Soak them in the bleach solution for about 5 minutes or in the vinegar solution for 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and let air dry."
What can you do to help remove germs in your dishwasher?,"Do you see a black fungus on the seal around your dishwasher door or inside your dishwasher? It may be Exophiala dermatitidis, a fungus that likes high heat and is resistant to most detergents. Scrub it away with a paste of vinegar and baking soda. While you're in the dishwasher, pour a couple of cups of vinegar in the bottom and run a cycle to kill other tough germs."
What can help you remove germs from your kitchen cutting board?,"Disinfect cutting boards by soaking them in straight vinegar or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water for about 30 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly with hot, soapy water or put them in the dishwasher. Using the dishwasher alone isn't enough to sanitize them."
What can help you remove germs from your kitchen counter?,"Spraying a 10% vinegar solution on counters will wipe out lots of kitchen counter germs at once. Keep the surface wet for 30 to 60 seconds, then wipe. Keep purses, briefcases, lunchboxes, keys, mail, and electronic devices like remote controls off countertops because they're teeming with germs."
When should I go to the doctor for my pain?,"Enduring the occasional headache or minor sports injury is one thing. But putting up with chronic pain can impair functioning and quality of life.

The infection causes inflammation in the inner ear around nerves that are important for helping the body sense balance Less often vertigo may be associated with: Head or neck injury Brain problems such as stroke or tumor Certain medications that cause ear damage Migraine headaches Vertigo is often triggered by a change in the position of your head.
How is vertigo treated by canalith repositioning maneuvers?,Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend a series of specific head and body movements for BPPV. The movements are done to move the calcium deposits out of the canal into an inner ear chamber so they can be absorbed by the body. You will likely have vertigo symptoms during the procedure as the canaliths move. A doctor or physical therapist can guide you through the movements.
How do you know if your vertigo is caused by Meniere's disease?,This is an inner ear disorder thought to be caused by a buildup of fluid and changing pressure in the ear. It can cause episodes of vertigo along with ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss.
What is vertigo associated with?,The infection causes inflammation in the inner ear around nerves that are important for helping the body sense balance Less often vertigo may be associated with: Head or neck injury Brain problems such as stroke or tumor Certain medications that cause ear damage Migraine headaches Vertigo is often triggered by a change in the position of your head.
How is surgery used to treat vertigo?,"In a few cases, surgery may be needed for vertigo. If vertigo is caused by a more serious underlying problem, such as a tumor or injury to the brain or neck, treatment for those problems may help to alleviate the vertigo."
What happens when you get ureteroscopy to treat kidney stones?,"Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible scope through your urethra, bladder and then into your ureter to reach the stone. If the stone is small, she can use a basket to remove it. If the stone is larger, a laser passed through the scope can break it up."
What types of prescription drugs can help with kidney stones?,"Prescription drugs can help: Calcium channel blockers and alpha-blockers: These relax your ureter, the tube through which pee passes from your kidney to your bladder. A wider ureter will help the stone move more quickly. Potassium citrate or sodium citrate: Can help keep kidney stones created by uric acid from forming."
What are percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy to help treat kidney stones?,Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. These similar surgical procedures are options if your stone is large or if other procedures fail to break them down enough. Your doctor uses a thin tube inserted through your skin to reach the stone and them removes (nephrolithotomy) or breaks (nephrolithotripsy) it. You will be given drugs so you won't be awake or feel pain. You'll likely have to stay in the hospital for 1-2 days.
What is open surgery for kidney stones?,"Open surgery: This might be an option if your stone is very oversized or your doctor can't take it out with other treatments. You'll be sedated and not awake. Your surgeon cuts through your side to reach the kidney, then takes the stone out through the opening. You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. It can take 4-6 weeks for you to fully recover. Your surgeon usually will ask a lab to identify the type of stone, so you might be able to take meds to avoid them in the future."
What is an exercise stress test?,"Also called an exercise electrocardiogram, treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ECG, an exercise stress test can tell your doctor how well your heart handles physical activity. You typically walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while your doctor watches your heart rate and blood pressure."
What should I ask the doctor before a stress test if I have diabetes?,"If you take insulin to control your blood sugar, ask your doctor how much medication you should take the day of the test and if you should eat a light meal."
What happens when you get an exercise stress test?,"You'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bicycle and be asked to gradually go faster or work harder. You'll do this until you reach a target heart rate, feel exhausted, or start having symptoms of heart issues. The lab technician will regularly ask how you're feeling. You should tell them if you feel pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, or jaw, are short of breath, dizzy, or lightheaded, or notice anything else unusual."
What happens after an exercise stress test?,"After the test, you'll walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. The technician will watch your heart rate, blood pressure, and EKG until they return to normal."
Why do I need a stress test?,Your doctor uses this test to: See if your heart gets enough blood when you're physically active See how likely you are to have coronary heart disease Check for abnormal heart rhythms Find out how well your heart medications are working or see if any procedures you've had done have improved the blood flow in your heart vessels Help figure out a safe exercise program for you Your doctor will give you specific instructions on what to do before your stress test.
What is a stress echocardiogram?,"Stress echocardiogram: An echocardiogram (often called an ""echo"") is a graphic outline of your heart's movement. A stress echo can show the motion of your heart's walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed. It can show a lack of blood flow that other heart tests can't."
Do some patients go into remission from rheumatoid arthritis after using combination therapy?,"Some people go into remission, which means they don't have any joint pain, swelling, or other RA symptoms. The goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms as much as possible without side effects from your medicine."
Can I take more than one medication to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Taking more than one medication can't reverse joint damage that you already have, and it isn't a cure. But it can prevent further damage and help you avoid other health problems that can come with rheumatoid arthritis, like heart attack and stroke."
What should I expect during combination therapy for rheumatoid arthritis?,"Combination therapy can mean less joint pain, morning stiffness, and inflammation. It can also help slow or stop your RA from getting worse. You might be able to have a more active life."
What is the outlook for children with Asperger's syndrome?,"Your doctor may prescribe some of these: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) Antipsychotic drugs Stimulant medicines With the right treatment, your child can learn to control some of the social and communication challenges he faces. He can do well in school and go on to succeed in life."
What medicines are used to treat Asperger's syndrome?,"There aren't any drugs approved by the FDA that specifically treat Asperger's or autism spectrum disorders. Some medications, though, can help with related symptoms like depression and anxiety. Your doctor may prescribe some of these: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) Antipsychotic drugs Stimulant medicines With the right treatment, your child can learn to control some of the social and communication challenges he faces."
What is it like for your child to have Asperger's syndrome?,"If your child has the condition, he may talk about himself most of the time and zero in with a lot of intensity on a single subject, like rocks or football stats. And he might repeat himself a lot, especially on a topic that he's interested in. He might also do the same movements over and over. He also may dislike change. For instance, he may eat the same food for breakfast every day or have trouble moving from one class to another during the school day."
How can applied behavior analysis help with Asperger's syndrome?,"It's a technique that encourages positive social and communication skills in your child -- and discourages behavior you'd rather not see. The therapist will use praise or other ""positive reinforcement"" to get results."
How can cognitive behavioral therapy help treat Asperger's syndrome?,"It helps your child change his way of thinking, so he can better control his emotions and repetitive behaviors. He'll be able to get a handle on things like outbursts, meltdowns, and obsessions."
How can social skills training help treat Asperger's syndrome?,"In groups or one-on-one sessions, therapists teach your child how to interact with others and express themselves in more appropriate ways. Social skills are often best learned by modeling after typical behavior."
Should I stay away from people who are sick?,"If possible, stay away from people who have a cold or the flu. If you can't -- because you're caring for a sick family member, for instance -- step up your hand-washing routine and your attention to other defenses against germs."
When should I get the flu shot?,"It's especially important if you're in a group that doctors say is at high risk for getting sick: Children Adults older than 50 Women who will be pregnant during flu season Nursing home residents People with asthma or a long-term heart or lung condition People with diabetes or another condition that weakens the immune system -- the body's defense against germs Health care workers For the best protection, get the flu vaccine when it comes out each year in October or November. But even later is better than not at all. It takes 2 weeks for the flu vaccine to take effect, and flu season can last into March or April."
What is the best method for hand washing to prevent sickness?,"Do it thoroughly: Use soap and water. Scrub for at least 20 seconds. Wash before you eat or prepare food and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper. If you're taking care of someone who's sick, wash your hands before and after being with them."
Do I have to stay home when I'm sick?,"Stay home when you're sick. If you go to school or work when you don't feel well, you can make a lot of people sick. Although a cold or flu might not be a big deal for you, it can be serious for people with weak immune systems, like young children, the elderly, and anyone with a long-term health problem. Working while you're sick isn't good for you, either. It can make it harder for your body to fight off a cold. So do what's best for you and everyone else. Take a couple of days off."
Who should get a flu vaccine?,"Anyone over 6 months old should get one. It's especially important if you're in a group that doctors say is at high risk for getting sick: Children Adults older than 50 Women who will be pregnant during flu season Nursing home residents People with asthma or a long-term heart or lung condition People with diabetes or another condition that weakens the immune system -- the body's defense against germs Health care workers For the best protection, get the flu vaccine when it comes out each year in October or November."
Should I wash cloths and towels more often if someone in my home is sick?,"Cold and flu germs can cling to fabric. So when someone in your house is sick, replace cloth hand towels and dishrags with paper towels. Remove water glasses and add paper cups in the bathroom, too."
Can using hand sanitizer keep me from getting sick?,"It's the next best thing if you can't get to a sink. Keep a small bottle with you -- at work, in your car, and in your purse. Buy one with at least 60% alcohol. Rub it all over your hands until they're dry."
How are heart failure and sleep related?,"Having heart failure means you're likely to have other health issues, including sleep problems. Likewise, sleep problems, including obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) and insomnia, can make your heart failure symptoms worse. A good night's sleep is important, whether your heart is healthy or not. Rest helps your heart as well as your energy levels, thinking skills, and overall health. If you can deal with your sleep problems, you may ease the burden on your heart."
How can a sleep specialist help with medical sleep problems?,"A sleep specialist can help you figure out what's going on medically, whether you're dealing with insomnia or OSA or something else, and how to treat it."
What is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?,"OSA is more common among people who are overweight, but anyone can get it. The tissue in the back of your throat relaxes and blocks your airway while you sleep. You stop breathing, so your brain signals your throat muscles to contract, which opens up your airway again. This can happen dozens or even hundreds of times a night."
How can heart failure make it hard to breathe while sleeping?,"During the day, you're standing and sitting, so extra fluid would normally settle in your legs and feet. But lie down, and it's going to move up into your chest and throat. This can close in your lungs and airway, making it harder to breathe. Your doctor might prescribe diuretics to help get rid of that extra fluid. But these medicines don't stop working when you sleep, which can mean interrupting your slumber for a trip or two to the bathroom."
What can you do to set yourself up for a restful night's sleep?,"Set yourself up for restful sleep: Stick to a regular sleep/wake schedule. Turn off the TV, computer, and other devices before bedtime. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Avoid alcohol before bedtime and caffeine in the afternoon or evening. Exercise every morning."
What are complications of heart failure that can affect your sleep?,For example: Chest pain and discomfort make it hard to relax and fall or stay asleep. Lying in bed can make you feel short of breath. You may have to get up during the night to pee.
What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?,"That's why regular prostate cancer screenings are so important. Once a tumor causes the prostate gland to swell, or once cancer spreads beyond the prostate, the following symptoms may happen: The need to pee often, especially at night Trouble starting or stopping a stream of urine A weak stream, or one that starts and stops Leaking when you laugh or cough Not being able to pee standing up Pain or burning when you pee Pain or burning when you ejaculate Less fluid when you ejaculate Blood in your pee or semen Pressure or pain in your rectum Pain or stiffness in your lower back, hips, pelvis, or thighs A decrease in the amount of fluid ejaculated New trouble getting an erection These aren't symptoms of the cancer itself."
When should you call your doctor about prostate cancer?,"Symptoms of advanced prostate cancer include: Dull, deep pain or stiffness in the pelvis, lower back, ribs, or upper thighs; pain in the bones of those areas Loss of weight and appetite Fatigue, nausea, or vomiting Swelling of the lower extremities Weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, often with constipation Bowel problems You have trouble urinating or find that urination is painful or different from normal; your doctor should examine your prostate gland to determine whether it is enlarged, inflamed with an infection, or cancerous. You have chronic pain in your lower back, pelvis, upper thighbones, or other bones. Pain in these areas can be caused by different things, including the spread of prostate cancer. You have unexplained weight loss. You have swelling in your legs. You have weakness in your legs or a hard time walking, especially if you also have constipation."
Should you drink water and go to the bathroom frequently if you have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"All adults and children with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should take frequent bathroom breaks. This helps to avoid over-distending the bladder, which can cause long-term problems, though rarely. The most important treatment for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is to ensure constant access to lots of water. Not keeping up with fluid losses can lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, which can sometimes be severe. Seek medical help if symptoms don't improve after rehydrating, eating fresh fruit, and taking a multivitamin."
How are my kidneys involved in my nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, enough ADH is produced. But the kidneys are partially or completely blind to it. Typically, the kidneys' ADH sensors are missing or defective. As a result, ADH flows by without effect. The kidneys don't absorb enough water. Instead, they excrete abundant dilute urine as if no ADH were present."
Can nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cause me to use the bathroom frequently?,"Symptoms of electrolyte imbalances include: Unexplained weakness Lethargy Muscle pains Irritability For someone without nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the extreme thirst it creates can be hard to understand. Some people need to drink a large glass of liquid every 15 minutes, all day, every day. And since the kidneys aren't holding that water in, that means a lot of bathroom breaks."
What causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems related to a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It's stored in the pituitary gland. Release of ADH is triggered by fluid loss or dehydration. When it's released, it causes the kidneys to retain water. This results in a decrease and concentration of urine."
What are mechanisms by which nephrogenic diabetes insipidus works?,"Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems related to a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It's stored in the pituitary gland. Release of ADH is triggered by fluid loss or dehydration.

Instead, they excrete abundant dilute urine as if no ADH were present."
What are symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,The lack of ability by the kidneys to conserve water leads to the symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. They include: Excessive thirst Excessive urine production (polyuria).
How do I know if my nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused an electrolyte imbalance?,"In some people, these symptoms can become extreme and cause dehydration. Excessive fluid losses can also cause electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms of electrolyte imbalances include: Unexplained weakness Lethargy Muscle pains Irritability For someone without nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the extreme thirst it creates can be hard to understand."
What does high blood pressure do to your body?,"When the heart beats, it pushes blood through the arteries in your entire body. Higher blood pressures mean that with each beat, arteries throughout the body swell and stretch more than they would normally. This stretching can injure the endothelium, the delicate lining of all arteries, causing arteries to become stiffer over time."
What can plaque in your arteries do to your body?,"The cholesterol and cells build up in the artery wall, eventually forming the plaque of atherosclerosis. Plaque is dangerous. Although it often grows without symptoms for years, plaque can suddenly rupture, forming a blood clot that blocks the artery, which keeps oxygen from getting to the heart muscle or the brain. The result can be a heart attack or stroke."
How is high blood pressure treated?,"For example, in middle-aged and older adults with high blood pressure, lowering systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 10 points leads to: 50% to 60% lower risk of dying from stroke 40% to 50% lower risk of death from a heart attack Exercise and a low-salt diet that is high in fruits and vegetables will reduce blood pressure by a moderate amount. Weight management is also important in maintaining a healthy blood pressure. For most people, though, medication is necessary to adequately control high blood pressure. In fact, most people will eventually require two or more drugs for blood pressure. Numerous drugs effectively treat hypertension."
What causes atherosclerosis?,"Because high blood pressure increases the risk of atherosclerosis, it raises the chance of developing all the complications of atherosclerosis, such as: Heart attack Stroke Peripheral arterial disease Erectile dysfunction Kidney disease When it comes to causing atherosclerosis, though, high blood pressure rarely acts alone. High blood pressure in isolation increases the risk of atherosclerosis, but it's particularly dangerous when it in combination with: Diabetes Abnormal cholesterol levels Cigarette smoking If you have any of these other risk factors and hypertension, your risk of atherosclerosis begins to rise dramatically."
What is the normal blood pressure?,"Normal blood pressure is less than 120 over less than 80. Treatment is recommended for blood pressure above 130 over 80 for most people. Treatment may be considered at lower levels, depending on other medical conditions you may have."
What can atherosclerosis lead to?,"Because high blood pressure increases the risk of atherosclerosis, it raises the chance of developing all the complications of atherosclerosis, such as: Heart attack Stroke Peripheral arterial disease Erectile dysfunction Kidney disease When it comes to causing atherosclerosis, though, high blood pressure rarely acts alone."
How is high blood pressure linked to atherosclerosis?,"High blood pressure is a major cause of atherosclerosis, the artery-clogging process that leads to heart attacks and strokes. Blood pressure higher than 130/80 is seen in: 69% of people who have their first heart attack 77% of people who have their first stroke 74% of people who have congestive heart failure High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, even if it is severely elevated."
What can lowering my blood pressure do for me?,"For example, in middle-aged and older adults with high blood pressure, lowering systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 10 points leads to: 50% to 60% lower risk of dying from stroke 40% to 50% lower risk of death from a heart attack Exercise and a low-salt diet that is high in fruits and vegetables will reduce blood pressure by a moderate amount."
How is hepatitis C known not to spread?,"If a mom has hepatitis C and her nipples are cracked and bleeding, she should stop nursing until her nipples have healed. Then she can resume nursing."
How can avoiding direct exposure to blood or blood products help prevent hepatitis C infection?,"If you are a medical worker or health care provider, avoid coming into direct contact with blood. Any tools that draw blood in the workplace should be thrown out safely or sterilized to prevent hepatitis C infection."
How can avoiding sharing personal care items help prevent hepatitis C infection?,"Often, people will cut themselves while shaving, or their gums will bleed while brushing their teeth. Even small amounts of blood can infect someone, so it is important not to share items such as toothbrushes, razors, nail and hair clippers, and scissors. If you already have hepatitis C, make sure you keep your personal items, such as razors and toothbrushes, separate and out of children's reach."
How can avoiding sharing needles help prevent hepatitis C infection?,"Besides needles, the virus may be present in other equipment used with illicit drugs."
How can practicing safe sex prevent hepatitis C?,"It is rare for hepatitis C to be transmitted through sexual intercourse, but there is a higher chance of getting hepatitis C if you have HIV, another sexually transmitted disease, multiple sex partners, or if you engage in rough sex."
How is hepatitis C transmission currently prevented?,"One of the main problems with preventing hepatitis C is that most people who are infected don't show symptoms at first. Many only find out when they have a blood test for an unrelated reason. Until relatively recently, this often led to infected blood and organs being used in transfusions and transplants. As of July 1992, all blood and organ donations are screened for the hepatitis C virus. Although not perfect, only about 1 in 2 million blood transfusions may transmit hepatitis C. Anyone who received a blood transfusion or organ donation before July 1992 should be tested for the virus. As of 1987, all blood products for the treatment of hemophilia are treated to remove infectious viruses, such as hepatitis C and HIV. But if you took any blood products before 1987, you should be tested for hepatitis C. There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C infection."
How should you choose tattoo and piercing parlors to prevent hepatitis C infection?,"Only use a licensed tattoo and piercing artist who does the right sanitary procedures. A new, disposable needle and ink well should be used for each customer. If in doubt, ask about their disposable products and sanitary procedures before getting a tattoo or piercing."
What are some symptoms of an insulin overdose?,"If you have low blood sugar because of an insulin overdose, you may have: Anxiety Confusion Extreme hunger Fatigue Irritability Sweating or clammy skin Trembling hands If your blood sugar levels continue to fall, you could have seizures or pass out."
What are the signs of an insulin overdose?,"Cold sweats, trembling hands, intense anxiety, a general sense of confusion -- these are signs of low blood sugar."
What should someone do if they have an insulin overdose?,"Don't panic. Most insulin overdoses can be treated at home. Follow these steps if you're able: Check your blood sugar. You'll need to know where you're starting from. Drink one-half cup of regular soda or sweetened fruit juice, and eat a hard candy or have glucose paste, tablets, or gel. If you skipped a meal, eat something now. Something with 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrates should raise your blood sugar. Rest. Get off your feet and take a break. Recheck your blood sugar after 15 or 20 minutes. If it's still low, take another 15 to 20 grams of a quick-acting sugar, and eat something if you can. Pay attention to how you feel for the next few hours. If you still have symptoms, check your sugar again an hour after eating. Keep snacking if your sugar is low. Get medical help if your sugar level stays low after 2 hours or if your symptoms don't get better."
How should you take long-term control asthma medications?,Some of these drugs should be taken daily to get your asthma under control and keep it that way. Others are taken on an as needed basis to reduce the severity of an asthma attack.
What are quick-relief asthma medications?,"These medications provide fast relief of asthma attack symptoms like cough, chest tightness, and wheezing. They include: Short-acting beta-agonists (bronchodilators) Anticholinergics. These are bronchodilators that can be paired with, or used instead of, short-acting beta-agonists. Systemic corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that get symptoms under control."
Can allergy shots treat my asthma?,"Children who get allergy shots are less likely to get asthma, recent studies show, but there are asthma shots specifically for adolescents and adults. Since allergies are an asthma trigger, it makes sense that if you control them, you'll have fewer asthma attacks."
How often will you have to take asthma medications?,"How often you need to take your medications depends on how severe your condition is and how frequently you have symptoms. For example, if you only have trouble when you exercise, you may only need to use an inhaler before a workout. But most people with asthma need daily treatment."
What problems could develop with a dental crown?,"Your newly crowned tooth may be sensitive immediately after the procedure as the anesthesia begins to wear off. If the tooth that has been crowned still has a nerve in it, you may experience some heat and cold sensitivity. Your dentist may recommend that you brush teeth with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. Pain or sensitivity that occurs when you bite down usually means that the crown is too high on the tooth. If this is the case, call your dentist. He or she can easily fix the problem."
What happens during the second visit for a dental crown?,"Second visit: Receiving the permanent dental crown At the second visit, your dentist will remove the temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. If everything is acceptable, a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place."
Why is a dental crown needed?,"A dental crown may be needed in the following situations: To protect a weak tooth (for instance, from decay) from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth To restore an already broken tooth or a tooth that has been severely worn down To cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there isn't a lot of tooth left To hold a dental bridge in place To cover misshapened or severely discolored teeth To cover a dental implant To make a cosmetic modification For children, a crown may be used on primary (baby) teeth in order to: Save a tooth that has been so damaged by decay that it can't support a filling."
What metals are used for dental crowns?,"Metals used in crowns include alloys that have a high content of gold or platinum, or base-metal alloys (for example, cobalt- chromium and nickel-chromium alloys). Metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. Also, metal crowns rarely chip or break. The metallic color -- and the high price of gold -- is the main drawback. Metal crowns are a good choice for out-of-sight molars."
What happens after reshaping a tooth for a dental crown?,"After reshaping the tooth, your dentist typically will use a paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. Sometimes, though, impressions are made with a digital scanner. Impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. The impressions or scans are sent to a dental lab where the crown will be manufactured. The crown is usually returned to your dentist's office in two to three weeks. If the crown is made of porcelain, your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. During this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. Temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement."
How are stainless steel dental crowns used?,"Stainless steel crowns are prefabricated crowns that are used on permanent teeth primarily as a temporary measure. The crown protects the tooth or filling while a permanent crown is made from another material. For children, a stainless steel crown is commonly used to fit over a primary tooth that's been prepared to fit it. The crown covers the entire tooth and protects it from further decay. When the primary tooth comes out to make room for the permanent tooth, the crown comes out naturally with it. In general, stainless steel crowns are used for children's teeth because they don't require multiple dental visits to put in place and so are more cost- effective than custom-made crowns and prophylactic dental care needed to protect a tooth without a crown."
How can you get a loose dental crown?,"Sometimes the cement washes out from under the crown. Not only does this allow the crown to become loose, it allows bacteria to leak in and cause decay to the tooth that remains. If a crown feels loose, contact your dentist's office."
How are porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns used?,"Porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns can be color matched to your adjacent teeth (unlike the metallic crowns). However, more wearing to the opposing teeth occurs with this crown type compared with metal or resin crowns. The crown's porcelain portion can also chip or break off. Next to all-ceramic crowns, porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns look most like normal teeth. However, sometimes the metal underlying the crown's porcelain can show through as a dark line, especially at the gum line and even more so if your gums recede. These crowns can be a good choice for front or back teeth as well as long bridges where the metal is needed for strength."
How much do dental crowns cost?,"Costs of crowns vary depending on what part of the country you live in and on the type of crown selected (porcelain versus gold, for example). Generally, crowns can range in cost from $800 to $1700 or more per crown. A portion of the cost of a crown is generally covered by insurance. To be certain, check with your dental insurance company."
How should I care for my temporary dental crown?,"Because temporary dental crowns are just that -- a temporary fix until a permanent crown is ready -- most dentists suggest that a few precautions. These include: Avoid sticky, chewy foods (for example, chewing gum, caramel), which have the potential of grabbing and pulling off the crown. Minimize use of the side of your mouth with the temporary crown. Shift the bulk of your chewing to the other side of the mouth. Avoid chewing hard foods (such as raw vegetables), which could dislodge or break the crown. Slide rather than lift out dental floss when cleaning between your teeth to avoid pulling off the temporary crown."
What happens before making a dental crown?,"Before the process of making a crown begins, your dentist will anesthetize (numb) the tooth and the gum tissue around the tooth. Next, the tooth receiving the crown is reshaped along the chewing surface and sides to make room for the crown. The amount removed depends on the type of crown used. If, on the other hand, a large area of the tooth is missing (due to decay or damage), your dentist will use filling material to ""build up"" the tooth to support the crown."
What happens during the first visit for a dental crown?,"First visit: Examining and preparing the tooth At the first visit in preparation for a crown, your dentist may take a few X-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone. If the tooth has extensive decay or if there is a risk of infection or injury to the tooth's pulp, a root canal treatment may first be performed."
How can you get an allergic reaction from a dental crown?,"Because the metals used to make crowns are usually a mixture of metals, an allergic reaction to the metals or porcelain used in crowns can occur, but this is extremely rare."
How does a dentist prepare a tooth for a dental crown?,"Preparing a tooth for a crown usually requires two visits to the dentist -- the first step involves examining and preparing the tooth, the second visit involves placement of the permanent crown. First visit: Examining and preparing the tooth At the first visit in preparation for a crown, your dentist may take a few X-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone."
How are all-resin dental crowns used?,"However, they wear down over time and are more prone to fractures than porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns. All-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns provide better natural color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for people with metal allergies."
How can autoimmune thyroiditis cause goiter?,"As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. It may not hurt. Left alone, the thyroid will eventually shrink on its own, but that doesn't mean you're cured. That just means your thyroid is damaged."
What foods and supplements can mess with your treatment for autoimmune thyroiditis?,You'll need to take medicine for the rest of your life.
What causes autoimmune thyroiditis?,Or it could be a combination of causes.
How is autoimmune thyroiditis treated?,"The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine ( Levo- T, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, Unithroid). It's a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes. Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while.

What should you expect in your 1-month-old's communication habits?,"One-month-old babies pretty much have one mode of communication -- crying. Your baby will cry for up to three hours a day (don't panic, the crying will decrease as time passes). Crying is baby's way of saying, '' I'm hungry - feed me!'' '' I have a wet diaper,'' or, '' I'm really tired.'' Eventually, you'll start to translate these cries, and discover the best ways to soothe him (for example by rocking or swaddling your baby). Some babies who cry too much may have colic or a medical problem, so call your doctor if you just can't console your newborn."
What should you expect in your 1-month-old's motor skills development?,"You'll notice that your baby was born with several innate reflexes, including sucking. Soon after birth, he will be able to (with a little help from you) latch on to a breast or nipple to feed. If you put your finger inside baby's palm, you'll notice that he'll close his fist around it (and many a proud father has bragged about the strength of his newborn's grip). Babies who are startled will quickly flare both arms and legs out and then pull them in. This is called the Moro reflex. Even at 1 month old, your baby has the instinct for walking. If you put a newborn's feet on a solid surface while supporting their body, they'll appear to take a few steps. Although 1-month-olds may be able to turn their head while lying on their stomach, they don't yet have the neck strength to support their head while upright. Make sure to put a hand under your baby's head whenever you lift him."
What are some tips for your baby's first month?,"Babies love to be touched. Give your 1-month-old lots of skin-to-skin contact, for example by holding and rocking, or giving him a gentle massage.

What should you expect in your 1-month-old's sleeping habits?,"In fact, newborns sleep 15 to 16 hours a day. Those hours may be erratic, because baby hasn't yet adjusted to the normal day and night cycle. You can help your baby adjust by limiting activities to daytime, and keeping things quiet, dark, and boring at night. Eventually he will get the hint that day is for play and night is for sleep. Also, your 1-month-old's sleep cycles are much different than yours. Unlike adults, newborn babies spend more time in REM sleep than in deeper non- REM sleep. That means they may wake up fairly easily during those first few weeks."
What should you expect in your 1-month-old's development of the senses?,"Newborns are very nearsighted. Your baby can see objects and people most clearly when they are just 8 to 12 inches away. That means he can see your face while he is nursing, and in fact, will prefer looking at you than at a stuffed animal, because infants are naturally drawn to human faces. They also prefer high-contrast objects because they're easier to see (although you needn't outfit your entire nursery in black-and-white; bright colors are good, too). You may notice that your 1-month-old's eyes cross when trying to focus. That is normal, because a newborn's eye control hasn't fully developed. However, if they remain crossed at three or four months, call your pediatrician, because it could be a sign of strabismus (crossed eyes). Although a newborn's hearing isn't yet fully developed, babies can recognize sounds -- especially their parents' voices, which they got used to hearing in the womb. They especially like high-pitched sounds; so don't get too annoyed when your mother-in-law uses that squeaky baby voice every time she talks to your newborn. If baby doesn't seem to be responding at all to sound, be sure to mention this to your pediatrician at your well visits. Many states screen all babies' hearing at birth, but be sure to mention hearing concerns to your pediatrician even if the birth test was OK. Like many older children (and adults), babies prefer sweet tastes. Their taste buds aren't yet mature enough to distinguish bitter and sour. They have a well-developed sense of smell, and can already pick out the scent of their mother's nipple, and breast milk, within the first few days of life."
What should you expect in your 1-month-old's growth development?,"Don't be alarmed if your baby loses some weight during the first few days of life. Babies are born with extra body fluid and typically lose up to 10% of their birth weight before they stabilize and start gaining. By their two-week birthday, babies should be back up to their birth weight, and during the first month they'll gain weight quickly -- putting on between a half-ounce and an ounce a day. Your doctor will check baby's weight gain against a growth chart during your well-baby visits, to make sure he is growing at the right rate."
What happens during stage III breast cancer?,"In stage III, the cancer has spread beyond the breast and into nearby lymph nodes.

How does hormone therapy treat stage III breast cancer?,"Hormone therapy can help women with hormone receptor-positive cancers. That means the cancer needs hormones to grow. In these women, medications can prevent the tumor from getting the hormone. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women and aromatase inhibitors anastrozole ( Arimidex), exemestane ( Aromasin), and letrozole ( Femara) for postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) and toremifene ( Fareston) block hormone receptors and are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. Women who haven't reached menopause may consider having their ovaries removed to stop them from making hormones that help cancer grow. Medications can also stop the ovaries from releasing hormones."
How does chemotherapy treat stage III breast cancer?,"Chemotherapy is a common treatment for stage III breast cancer. Sometimes people have chemo before surgery to shrink a tumor and make it easier to remove. It can help destroy cancer cells that remain after surgery. In cases where surgery isn't an option, chemotherapy may be the main treatment."
What are the symptoms of drug allergy?,"Symptoms of a drug allergy can range from mild to life-threatening.

What is cholesterol ratio and what should yours be?,"To find your cholesterol ratio, you divide your total cholesterol number by your HDL, or good, cholesterol number. For example, if your total cholesterol number is 200 and your good cholesterol is 50, your total cholesterol ratio is 4:1. Cholesterol ratio may be used as a monitoring tool by some health care specialists. However, the AHA suggests that doctors use LDLcholesterol with patients rather than cholesterol ratio. That's because the total cholesterol number is considered a better tool for guiding the doctor in planning the best patient care and helping patients understand their health risks. Discuss with your doctor what the best numbers to monitor for you are."
What helps fragile hair caused by lupus?,"Try these tips to keep your hair healthy and look your best: For fragile hair: Avoid pulling your hair.

For sores in your nose, try soothing them with petroleum jelly."
What are the uses and limitations of an erythrocyte sedimentation rate test for lupus?,"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR) What it is: ESR measures the speed of red blood cells moving toward the bottom of a test tube. When inflammation is present, blood proteins stick together and fall and collect more quickly as sediment. The more quickly the blood cells fall, the greater the inflammation. Why the test is used: ESR is used as a marker of inflammation. Inflammation could indicate lupus activity. This test could be used to monitor inflammation, which could indicate changes in disease activity or response to treatment. Limitations of the test: Like CRP, the ESR is not specific to lupus. Because there are many causes for a positive result, including infection, the test is not diagnostic for lupus. Nor can it distinguish a lupus flare from an infection. Also, the level doesn't directly correlate with lupus disease activity. So it isn't necessarily useful for monitoring disease activity."
What are the uses and limitations of a chemistry panel for lupus?,"Chemistry Panel What it is: A chemistry panel is a test to assess kidney function and liver function. It also gives information on electrolytes, blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Why the test is used: Abnormalities may indicate the development of complications from lupus. They could also result from treatments for such conditions as kidney disease, elevated blood sugar levels, elevated cholesterol levels, and liver disease."
What are the uses and limitations of an anti-Ro(SSA) and anti-La(SSB) test for lupus?,"Anti- Ro( SSA) and Anti- La( SSB) What it is: Anti- Ro( SSA) and Anti- La( SSB) are two antibodies that are commonly found together. They are specific against ribonucleic acid ( RNA) proteins. Why the test is used: Anti- Ro is found in anywhere from 24% to 60% of lupus patients. It's also found in 70% of people with another autoimmune disorder called SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. Anti- La is found in 35% of people with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. For this reason, their presence may be useful in diagnosing one of these disorders. Both antibodies are associated with neonatal lupus, a rare but potentially serious problem in newborns. In pregnant women, a positive Anti- Ro( SSA) or Anti- La( SSB) warns doctors of the need to monitor the unborn baby. Limitations of the test: Like other antibodies, the fact that the test is not positive in many people with lupus means it can't be used to diagnose lupus. Also, it is more indicative of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome than of lupus."
What are the uses and limitations of an antiphospholipid antibodies test for lupus?,"Antiphospholipid Antibodies ( APLs) What it is: APLs are a type of antibody directed against phospholipids. Why the test is used: APLs are present in up to 60% of people with lupus. Their presence can help confirm a diagnosis. A positive test is also used to help identify women with lupus that have certain risks that require preventive treatment and monitoring. Those risks include blood clots, miscarriage, or preterm birth. Limitations of the test: APLs may also occur in people without lupus. Their presence alone is not enough for a lupus diagnosis."
What are the uses and limitations of an antinuclear antibody test for lupus?,"Antinuclear Antibody ( ANA) What it is: ANA is a type of antibody directed against the cells' nuclei. Why the test is used: ANA is present in nearly everybody with active lupus. Doctors often use the ANA test as a screening tool. Plus, looking at patterns of the antibodies can sometimes help doctors determine the specific disease a person has. That, in turn, helps determine which treatment would be most appropriate. Limitations of the test: Although almost all people with lupus have the antibody, a positive result doesn't necessarily indicate lupus. Positive results are often seen with some other diseases and in a smaller percentage of people without lupus or other autoimmune disorders. So a positive ANA by itself is not enough for a lupus diagnosis. Doctors must consider the result of this test along with other criteria."
What are the uses and limitations of a complete blood cell count for lupus?,"Complete Blood Cell Count ( CBC) What it is: CBC is a test to measure levels of different blood cells. Why the test is used: Abnormalities in blood cell counts, including white blood cells and red blood cells, may occur in people with lupus. This may be related to the lupus, lupus treatments, or infection. For example, leukopenia, a decrease in the number of white blood cells, is found in about 50% of people with lupus. Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, occurs in about 50% of people with lupus, as well. Doctors can use this test to monitor these potentially serious problems. Limitations of the test: Many other medical conditions can cause abnormalities in blood cell counts. So the test by itself is not specific to a lupus diagnosis."
What are the uses and limitations of an anti-Sm test for lupus?,"Anti- Sm What it is: Anti- Sm is an antibody directed against Sm, a specific protein found in the cell nucleus. Why the test is used: The protein is found in up to 30% of people with lupus. It's rarely found in people without lupus. So a positive test can help confirm a lupus diagnosis. Limitations of the test: Up to only 30% of people with lupus have a positive anti- Sm test. So relying on an anti- Sm result alone would miss a large majority of people with lupus."
What are the uses and limitations of an anti-dsDNA for lupus?,"Anti-ds DNA What it is: Anti-ds DNA is a protein directed against double-stranded DNA. DNA is the material that makes up the body's genetic code. Why the test is used: Between 75% and 90% of people with lupus have a positive anti-ds DNA test. Also, the test is very specific for lupus. Therefore, a positive test can be useful in confirming a diagnosis. For many people, the titer, or level, of the antibodies rises as the disease becomes more active. So, doctors can also use it to help measure disease activity. Also, the presence of anti-ds DNA indicates a greater risk of lupus nephritis, a kidney inflammation that occurs with lupus. So a positive test can alert doctors to the need to monitor the kidneys. Limitations of the test: Up to 25% of people with lupus have a negative test. So, a negative test doesn't mean a person doesn't have lupus."
What are side effects of antiplatelet drugs?,"Antiplatelets can cause: Nausea Upset stomach Stomach pain Diarrhea Rash Itching To ease nausea and stomach upset, take these with meals. Call your doctor if these side effects are severe or don't go away."

What are antiplatelet drugs used for?,"When you are wounded, platelets arrive on the scene and group together to form a clot that stops the bleeding. This is a good thing when an injury involves a break in your skin. But platelets can also group when injury to a blood vessel comes from the inside, as may happen in an artery affected by atherosclerosis. In this situation, the platelets cause blood clots in an already injured artery. Antiplatelet medications can prevent this from happening. Antiplatelets may be prescribed to folks with a history of: Coronary artery disease Heart attack Angina (chest pain) Stroke and transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs) Peripheral artery disease Antiplatelets are also used: After angioplasty and stent placement After heart bypass or valve replacement surgery Usually once or twice a day."
How is transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) used to treat bleeding varices?,A radiological procedure in which a stent (a tubular device) is placed in the middle of the liver. The stent connects the hepatic vein with the portal vein. This procedure is done by placing a catheter through a vein in the neck. It is done to relieve the high blood pressure that has built up in the portal vein and the liver.
How do you treat severe cases of bleeding varices?,"This increased pressure in the portal vein causes blood to be pushed away from the liver to smaller blood vessels, which are not able to handle the increased amount of blood."
How serious is bleeding from varices?,"Symptoms include: Vomiting of blood Black, tarry, or bloody stool Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Lightheadedness Shock (in severe cases) Bleeding from varices is a medical emergency. If the bleeding is not controlled quickly, a person may go into shock or die. Even after the bleeding has been stopped, there can be serious complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, confusion, and coma."

If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack."
How can I prepare for long exercise sessions if I have diabetes?,"If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise. If you're going to head out for a bike trip, marathon, or day-long hike, take some snacks with you. Food may not be easy to carry around if you're in a race.

Is the bird flu going to be the next flu pandemic?,"While experts say it's inevitable that sooner or later we'll see another flu pandemic, it's by no means certain that the current bird flu virus will be the cause. Even if a new human flu emerges, public health officials might be able to contain it. H5 N1 is susceptible to the newer flu drugs. And a vaccine already has been created and stockpiled by the World Health Organization."
How could the bird flu become airborne or more of a risk to humans?,"If a person -- or a susceptible animal -- gets infected with bird flu and human flu at the same time, the bird and human flu viruses could swap genes. Even without swapping genes, H5 N1 could mutate into a form that more easily infects humans. The lab-created H5 N1 mutants remain in high-security labs. But the mutations needed to make H5 N1 an airborne, human virus already exist in H5 N1 viruses seen in nature. So far, the full set of mutations has not appeared in the same virus."

What causes meningitis?,"Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days and may include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can't lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Meningitis is almost always caused by a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, like your ears, sinuses, or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis It's an extremely serious illness."
What is fungal meningitis?,"Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. Someone with a problem with their immune system -- because they have AIDS, for example -- is more likely to become infected with this form of meningitis."
Who's more likely to get meningitis?,"Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults ages 16-25 Adults over 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen, long-term disease, or immune system disorders. Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease."
What are the different types of meningitis?,"There are several causes of this disease, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Bacterial meningitis can be life-threatening and spreads between people in close contact with each other. Viral meningitis tends to be less severe, and most people recover completely without treatment. Fungal meningitis is a rare form of the disease. It usually happens only in people whose immune system -- the body's defense against germs -- has been weakened."
How does bacterial meningitis spread?,"The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze. If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it."
How does bacterial meningitis start?,"In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses, ears, or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain."

Will precision medicines cure cancer?,"Cancers can evolve over time and become resistant to a treatment. Or a drug may work against only part of a tumor, which lets the remaining part continue to grow."
Where is precision medicine most used currently?,"Where precision medicine is starting to make a difference is in the treatment of some cancers. Researchers are beginning to change how they classify tumors. The genetics of some breast cancers, for instance, may be more like stomach tumors than other breast cancers. With precision medicine, cancers that are genetically alike are treated similarly. For example, doctors know a drug called Gleevec (imatinib) works to treat leukemia only when the cancer cells have one particular genetic makeup. So, rather than treat everyone with leukemia using Gleevec, doctors test people for that specific genetic mix and give the drug only to those who have it. They're using the same approach to decide which meds people take for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, as well as melanoma."

How are low-pressure headaches treated?,"Treatment: Your symptoms may go away by themselves. Sometimes, rest, drinking lots of water, and caffeine may help. A common treatment is something called an epidural blood patch, which tries to stop your CSF leak. Blood is taken from your arm and injected into an area of your spinal canal to âpatchâ the leak. This may not work the first time -- the actual spot where the CSF leaks is hard to find -- so you may have to go through the procedure several times. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called theophylline."

It works best for small or medium stones. It's noninvasive, which means no cuts are made in your skin. During this procedure, you lie on a table. You'll get medicine beforehand to limit any pain or discomfort. The doctor uses an X-ray or ultrasound to find the stone (or stones) in your kidney. Then, she aims high-energy shock waves at your kidney from the outside. These waves go through your skin and break up the stone into small pieces. The doctor might put a tube called a stent into your ureter (urine flows through this from your kidneys to your bladder). This stent helps the pieces of stone pass. SWL takes about an hour. You'll usually go home on the same day. Afterward, you'll drink lots of water to flush the stone pieces out in your urine. You might have to pee through a strainer to catch pieces of the stone so she can test them. SWL removes kidney stones in about half of people who have it.

In addition, ask your doctor about the benefits of healthy lifestyle habits such as eating a well-balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and being with close friends and family members for strong social support. These positive habits are also important in improving mood and well-being."
How can you have delusions if you have schizophrenia?,"These are beliefs that seem strange to most people and are easy to prove wrong. The person affected might think someone is trying to control their brain through TVs or that the FBI is out to get them. They might believe they're someone else, like a famous actor or the president, or that they have superpowers."
What is it like to have severe schizophrenia?,"When the disease is in full swing and symptoms are severe, the person with schizophrenia can't tell when certain ideas and perceptions they have are real or not. This happens less often as they get older."
What are cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia?,"These symptoms reflect how well the person's brain learns, stores, and uses information. Someone with schizophrenia might have a hard time with their working memory. For example, they may not be able to keep track of different kinds of facts at the same time, like a phone number plus instructions. Along with having trouble paying attention, it can be hard for them to organize their thoughts and make decisions."
Who is likely to get affected by schizophrenia?,They usually start between ages 16 and 30. Men often get them earlier than women.
How can you have trouble concentrating if you have schizophrenia?,"For example, someone might lose track of what's going on in a TV show as they're watching."
How  does schizophrenia affect movement?,"Some people with schizophrenia can seem jumpy. Sometimes they'll make the same movements over and over again. But sometimes they might be perfectly still for hours at a stretch, which experts call being catatonic. Contrary to popular belief, people with the disease usually aren't violent."
Can an oral surgeon help with my impacted teeth?,"Impacted teeth: This mostly happens with wisdom teeth. But it can happen in other places in your mouth, too. When the teeth come through the gums for the first time, it might be crowded, so they either don't come out at all or don't come out completely. This can cause sore gums and infections. Your dentist or surgeon might recommend you get your wisdom teeth pulled, even before they present any problems."
How can an oral surgeon help me with a missing tooth?,"Implants: You can replace a missing tooth with a dental implant. The surgeon imbeds a titanium implant into your jaw, then your dentist attaches a crown."
What conditions can oral surgeons help treat?,"Cancer treatment: Oral surgeons also treat cancers, not just of the mouth, but also of the head and neck, like of the salivary glands, sinuses, throat, larynx, and lips. Oral surgeons can also help with: Nerve repair Cleft lips and cleft palate surgery Removal of lesions on the face or inside the mouth If you have problems with your teeth or gums, talk with your dentist."
Can an oral surgeon help with issues with my jaw joint?,"Jaw-joint issues: The temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) connects your jaw to your skull. It's that little âhingeâ right in front of the ears. It can cause problems like pain in your jaw, jaw-popping, stiffness, and headaches. Oral devices, pain medication, and ice packs can help. But people with recurring problems may need oral surgery."
Can an oral surgeon help correct issues with breathing and sleep?,"Sleep and breathing issues: This covers things like snoring and sleep apnea, a condition that causes you to stop breathing for brief periods during sleep. A doctor with special training may recommend a CPAP machine or other appliance that can open your airway. He may also want you to have surgery, and you'd go to an oral surgeon. The type of surgery you'd have would depend on what's blocking your breathing."
"If I have problems with my teeth, gums, or jaws, why should I talk to my dentist first?","If you have problems with your teeth, gums, or jaws, go see your dentist, even if the pain is in the area around your mouth or face. If it's an emergency and a dentist is not available, head to an urgent care clinic rather than the ER. It's best, though, to try to avoid both if possible. They will only administer medication for the symptoms and tell you to see a dentist. They may also charge 3 to 4 times what it may cost to solve the problem. Your dentist can handle most oral problems. If he thinks you need an oral surgeon, he'll recommend one."
"What are oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and what kind of training do they get?","If your dentist recommends maxillofacial surgery, he's talking about a specialty of dentistry that relates to your face and jaws. It's a surgery that treats disease and injuries of the areas around your mouth. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must complete extra training and education beyond what is normal for a dentist. Some get a medical degree (an MD) along with their oral surgery diplomas. They put in at least 4 years of training in a hospital-based surgical program alongside medical residents in many different specialties, including anesthesia. That includes various types of IV sedation, including ""twilight sleep"" and general anesthesia, where you're unconscious and can't feel any pain."
Can cold air trigger allergies?,"Many people with allergic asthma find that cold air is a problem, especially when they exercise outside. It can trigger a coughing fit."
Can heat trigger allergies?,Air pollution is worst on hot summer days. Ozone and smog can be a serious trigger for people with allergic asthma.
How can I make my home more allergy-proof?,Use air conditioning to filter out mold and pollen. Use a dehumidifier to ward off mold growth and dust mites.
What are the common weather triggers for allergies?,"Wind blows pollen into the air, causing hay fever. If you have pollen allergies, shut the windows and stay indoors on windy days. Rainy or humid days. Moisture makes mold grow, both indoors and out. Dust mites also thrive in humid air. But if you're allergic to pollen, humid or damp days are good. The moisture weighs down the pollen, keeping it on the ground. Cold air. Many people with allergic asthma find that cold air is a problem, especially when they exercise outside. It can trigger a coughing fit. Heat. Air pollution is worst on hot summer days."
Can rainy or humid days trigger allergies?,"Moisture makes mold grow, both indoors and out. Dust mites also thrive in humid air. But if you're allergic to pollen, humid or damp days are good. The moisture weighs down the pollen, keeping it on the ground."
How can season change affect allergies?,"In cooler states, plants start to release pollens in February or March. Tree pollens are also a common spring allergy cause. Summer. Early in summer, grass pollen can trigger reactions. Later in the summer, ragweed and other weeds can become a problem. Mold can hit its peak in July in the warmer states. Fall. Ragweed season usually ends with the first frost in October. In colder states, mold tends to be worst in the fall. Winter. Indoor allergens -- like pet dander and dust mites -- can become more of a problem in winter."
What neurotransmitters play a role in bipolar disorder?,"Disruption of circuits that communicate using dopamine in other brain areas appears connected to psychosis and schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by distortions in reality and illogical thought patterns and behaviors. The brain chemical serotonin is connected to many body functions such as sleep, wakefulness, eating, sexual activity, impulsivity, learning, and memory. Researchers believe that abnormal functioning of brain circuits that involve serotonin as a chemical messenger contribute to mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder)."
Can lack of sleep cause bipolar disorder?,"Some findings show that people with bipolar disorder have a genetic predisposition to sleep-wake cycle problems that may trigger symptoms of depression and mania. The problem for those with bipolar disorder, however, is that sleep loss may lead to a mood episode such as mania (elation) in some patients. Worrying about losing sleep can increase anxiety, thus worsening the bipolar mood disorder altogether. Once a sleep-deprived person with bipolar disorder goes into the manic state, the need for sleep decreases even more."
How does progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) work?,"Here is how it works; While inhaling, contract one muscle group (for example your upper thighs) for 5 seconds to 10 seconds, then exhale and suddenly release the tension in that muscle group. Give yourself 10 seconds to 20 seconds to relax, and then move on to the next muscle group (for example your buttocks). While releasing the tension, try to focus on the changes you feel when the muscle group is relaxed. Imagery may be helpful in conjunction with the release of tension, such as imagining that stressful feelings are flowing out of your body as you relax each muscle group. Gradually work your way up the body contracting and relaxing muscle groups."
Who first came up with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)?,The technique of progressive muscle relaxation was described by Edmund Jacobson in the 1930s and is based upon his premise that mental calmness is a natural result of physical relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation can be learned by nearly anyone and requires only 10 minutes to 20 minutes per day to practice.
What is progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) for stress and insomnia?,"Progressive muscle relaxation is based upon the simple practice of tensing, or tightening, one muscle group at a time followed by a relaxation phase with release of the tension. Doctors have used progressive muscle relaxation in combination with standard treatments for symptom relief in a number of conditions, including headaches, cancer pain, high blood pressure, and digestive disturbances."
What is bursitis?,"Bursitis is the inflammation or irritation of the bursa. The bursa is a sac filled with lubricating fluid, located between tissues such as bone, muscle, tendons, and skin, that decreases rubbing, friction, and irritation."
How can my doctor help with bursitis?,"Bursitis can be treated in a number of ways, including: Avoiding activities that aggravate the problem Resting the injured area Icing the area the day of the injury Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines If the condition does not improve in a week, see your doctor. Your doctor can also prescribe drugs to reduce the inflammation. Corticosteroids, also known simply as ""steroids,"" are often used because they work quickly to decrease the inflammation and pain. Steroids can be injected directly at the site of injury. Injections are often, but not always, effective and can be repeated . However, multiple injections in a several month period are usually avoided due to potential side effects from the injections and the possibility of masking problems that need to be treated differently. Physical therapy is another treatment option that is often used. This includes range-of-motion exercises and splinting (thumb, forearm, or bands)."
When should I consult my doctor about bursitis?,"Consult your doctor if you have: Fever (over 102 Fahrenheit) -- infection is a possibility Swelling, redness, and warmth General illness or multiple sites of pain Inability to move the affected area These could be signs of another problem that needs more immediate attention."
What are the symptoms of bursitis?,"Elbow Shoulder Hip Knee Achilles tendon The most common symptom of bursitis is pain. The pain may build up gradually or be sudden and severe, especially if calcium deposits are present. Severe loss of motion in the shoulder -- called ""adhesive capsulitis"" or frozen shoulder -- can also result from the immobility and pain associated with shoulder bursitis."
Who usually gets bursitis?,"Bursitis is more common in adults, especially in those over 40 years of age."
Do I need surgery to treat bursitis?,"Surgery, although rarely needed, may be an option when bursitis does not respond to the other treatment options."
How is bursitis treated?,"Bursitis can be treated in a number of ways, including: Avoiding activities that aggravate the problem Resting the injured area Icing the area the day of the injury Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines If the condition does not improve in a week, see your doctor."
How can I prevent bursitis?,"The pain may build up gradually or be sudden and severe, especially if calcium deposits are present. Severe loss of motion in the shoulder -- called ""adhesive capsulitis"" or frozen shoulder -- can also result from the immobility and pain associated with shoulder bursitis. If you are planning to start exercising, you will be less likely to get bursitis if you gradually build up force and repetitions."
What causes bursitis?,"Bursitis is most often caused by repetitive, minor impact on the area, or from a sudden, more serious injury. Age also plays a role. As tendons age they are able to tolerate stress less, are less elastic, and are easier to tear. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Overuse or injury to the joint at work or play can also increase a person's risk of bursitis. Examples of high-risk activities include gardening, raking, carpentry, shoveling, painting, scrubbing, tennis, golf, skiing, throwing, and pitching. Incorrect posture at work or home and poor stretching or conditioning before exercise can also lead to bursitis. An abnormal or poorly placed bone or joint (such as length differences in your legs or arthritis in a joint) can put added stress on a bursa sac, causing bursitis. Stress or inflammation from other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, thyroid disorders, or unusual medication reactions may also increase a person's risk. In addition, an infection can occasionally lead to inflammation of a bursa."
Are your lungs congested because of pneumonia?,Sometimes it starts out as the flu. You may feel short of breath or get other symptoms like: Coughing up yellow-green or bloody phlegm Fever Chills Localized chest pain when you breathe in See your doctor if any of those happen to you or you think you might have pneumonia.
Are your lungs congested because of allergies?,"Anything you're allergic to can make it harder to breathe, and result in a congested chest, watery eyes, and wheezing. Pollen, dust, and pet dander (tiny flecks of skin shed by animals) are some common culprits. There are lots of ways to get relief. Drugs like antihistamines and decongestants may help. So may regular allergy shots."
Are your lungs congested because of asthma?,"Your symptoms may include: Chest pain Shortness of breath Hoarseness Coughing up blood Lung infections like bronchitis and pneumonia If you have it, your swollen airways are sensitive to things you're exposed to every day, like allergy triggers such as pollen, air pollutants, or chemicals in your workplace. The disease tends to run in families. With asthma, you may notice a wheezing sound when you breathe. Sometimes you only have it after you exercise or when you have a cold. Your chest may also feel tight. And you might have a cough at night or get short of breath. A lot of medicines can help, including inhalers that you breathe in to give you quick relief."
Are your lungs congested because of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"It's sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis, and it can make you short of breath. Smoking causes this disease most of the time. When you have COPD, the airways in your lungs get inflamed and thicken, which means less oxygen comes in and less carbon dioxide goes out. Over time, the shortness of breath gets worse. Your doctor can give you medication to help you manage the symptoms. If the problems get worse, you may need to use an oxygen tank to help with your breathing trouble."
Are your lungs congested because of a heart attack?,"Get medical help right away if you also have any of these: Pressure or squeezing in the center of your chest Pain in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach Feeling short of breath Sweating, nausea, light-headedness It's a serious condition that starts when your heart doesn't pump as strongly as it should."
Can stress cause shaky hands?,"Stress: From financial and job worries to relationship problems and health concerns, stress worsens tremors. Intense anger, extreme hunger, or sleep deprivation can all make your hands shake. This is known as physiologic tremor."
Does multiple sclerosis cause tremors?,"This disease, which targets your immune system, brain, nerves, and spinal cord, can also make your hands shake. You're most likely to have a tremor in your hand or foot. MS can cause a variety of tremors. The most common, like Essential Tremor, happens when you're already moving."
How can taking medication or drugs cause tremors?,Sometimes a tremor is your body's response to something: Drugs : The most common culprits are medications that block a brain chemical called dopamine. It moves information from one part of your brain to another. These drugs are used to keep your mood even. The tremors will go away when you stop taking the drugs.
What are the causes of essential tremor?,"Toxins in the environment cause some cases. But more research is needed to better understand the connections. Age is another risk factor. Although Essential Tremor can happen at any age, it's more likely in people over 40. Your odds go up as you get older."
Does the existence of tremors mean I have Parkinson's disease?,"Tremor is an early sign of Parkinson's disease, which affects 10 million people worldwide. Not everyone who has this disease gets shaky, but most people in the early stages will have slight movement in a hand, foot, or even a single finger Most of the time, the tremor affects only one side of your body."
What is the reason why my hands are shaking?,"Essential Tremor is the most common tremor disorder. It usually starts in your hands, but it can move to your arms, head, voice, or other body parts. ET is different because it affects your hands when they're already moving. Most other forms of tremor take place when you're still. It could result from a gene (your doctor may call this a mutation). That means if one of your parents has a tremor, you're more likely to get one, too."
Are tremors an early sign for any diseases?,"Tremor is an early sign of Parkinson's disease, which affects 10 million people worldwide. Not everyone who has this disease gets shaky, but most people in the early stages will have slight movement in a hand, foot, or even a single finger Most of the time, the tremor affects only one side of your body."
How can low blood sugar cause tremors?,It triggers your body's natural stress response and makes you shaky.
Can a B12 deficiency cause shaky hands?,"B12 deficiency: Without it, your nervous system won't work like it should. You can find it in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and milk products. If you're getting so little that your hands shake, your doctor will give you a shot."
Can you get a tremor from alcohol withdrawal?,"Tremor is one of the first signs. If you weren't too hooked, the shakes may last just a few days. If you drank a lot, or for a long time, they can go on for a year or even longer."
How are stitches (sutures) removed?,"Stitches typically need to remain in place for several days to a couple of weeks, depending on the severity of the cut and location. Your doctor will tell you when to come back to have them taken out. Removing stitches is a much faster process than putting them in. The doctor simply clips each thread near the knot and pulls them out. You may feel a slight tugging sensation, but the removal of stitches shouldn't hurt at all. You won't even need an anesthetic. Although removing stitches is not a difficult process, you shouldn't try to remove them yourself."
What are other options for stitches (sutures)?,"Stitches aren't the only option doctors have to close cuts and incisions. Cuts sometimes can be held together with butterfly tape or adhesive strips, which you may be able to do yourself at home for more minor cuts. There are even special staples or tissue glue, but those tend to work best with clean, straight incisions, such as in surgical procedures. There are different criteria and care instructions for each type of closure. Your health care provider can help decide which is best for you and tell you how to care for your injury as it heals."
What information should I report if an animal has rabies?,"Notify the local health department or animal control about the animal's possible whereabouts. If the animal is a pet, get owner's contact information."
What is retinis pigmentosa?,"Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP) is a term for a group of eye diseases that can lead to loss of sight. What they have in common is a coloring your doctor sees when he looks at your retina -- a bundle of tissue at the back of your eye. When you have RP, cells in the retina called photoreceptors don't work the way they're supposed to, and over time, you lose your sight. It's a rare disorder that's passed from parent to child. Only 1 out of every 4,000 people get it. About half of all people with RP have a family member who also has it."
What are the differences between rods and cones?,"The retina has two types of cells that gather light: rods and cones. The rods are around the outer ring of the retina and are active in dim light. Most forms of retinitis pigmentosa affect the rods first. Your night vision and your ability to see to the side -- peripheral vision -- go away. Cones are mostly in the center of your retina. They help you see color and fine detail. When RP affects them, you slowly lose your central vision and your ability to see color."
What are the treatment options for retinitis pigmentosa?,"A few options can slow your vision loss and may even restore some sight: Acetazolamide: In the later stages, the tiny area at the center of your retina can swell. This is called macular edema, and it, too, can reduce your vision. This medication can ease swelling and improve your vision. Vitamin A palmitate: High doses of this compound may slow retinitis pigmentosa a little each year. But you have to be careful, because too much can be toxic. Work closely with your doctor and follow her recommendations. Sunglasses: These make your eyes less sensitive to light and protect your eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays that may speed vision loss. Retinal implant: If you have late-stage RP, you may be a candidate a retinal implant that could provide partial sight. Argus II is the implant available in the US. It's implanted into a single eye and paired with glasses equipped with a camera. Images are converted to electrical pulses that are sent to the retina. Many were able to locate lights and windows. Some were able to determine where other people were located in a room and about half of the subjects were able to read letter that were about 9 inches high. Other treatments under review include: Replacement of damaged cells or tissues with healthy ones Gene therapy to put healthy genes into the retina Devices and tools can help you make the most of your vision, and rehab services can help you stay independent."
How does an eye doctor diagnose retinitis pigmentosa?,"He'll look into your eyes and do some special tests: Ophthalmoscope: The doctor will put drops into your eyes to make your pupil wider to get a better look at your retina. He will use a handheld tool to look into the back of your eye. If you have RP, there will be specific kinds of dark spots on your retina. Visual field test: You'll look through a tabletop machine at a point in the center of your vision. While staring at that point, objects or lights will appear to the side. You'll press a button when you see them, and the machine will create a map of how far to the side you can see. Electroretinogram: The eye doctor will put a film of gold foil or a special contact lens on your eye. Then he will measure how your retina responds to flashes of light. Genetic test: You'll submit a DNA sample to find out which form of RP you have. If you or anyone in your family is diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, all family members should go to the eye doctor for screening."
What causes retinitis pigmentosa?,"More than 60 different genes can cause the different types of retinitis pigmentosa. Parents can pass the problem genes on to their children in three different ways: Autosomal recessive RP: Each parent has one problem copy and one normal copy of the gene that's responsible, but they don't have any symptoms. A child that inherits two problem copies of the gene (one from each parent) will develop this type of retinitis pigmentosa. Since two copies of the problem gene are needed, each child in the family has a 25% chance of being affected. Autosomal dominant RP: This type of retinitis pigmentosa requires only one copy of the problem gene to develop. A parent with that gene has a 50% chance of passing it to each child. X-linked RP: A mother who carries the problem gene can pass it down to her children. Each one of them has a 50% chance of getting it. Most women who carry the gene won't have any symptoms. But about 1 out of every 5 will have mild symptoms. Most men who get it will have more severe cases. Fathers who have the gene can't pass it to their children."
What are the two parts of a pacemaker?,"The pacemaker has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The pulse generator houses the battery and a tiny computer, and resides just under the skin of the chest. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. They send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle, as well as sense the heart's electrical activity."
When should you call your doctor after you have a pacemaker implanted?,"Look at your wound every day to make sure it is healing. Call your doctor if you notice: Increased drainage, bleeding, or oozing from the insertion site Increased opening of the incision Redness around the site Warmth along the site Increased body temperature (fever or chills) Your pacemaker settings will be checked before you leave the hospital."
What conditions look like shingles?,"Your doctor might check to see if you have: Contact dermatitis: A skin reaction caused by an allergy to latex, metals, chemicals, or drugs Candida infection: It comes from a type of yeast called Candida Dermatitis herpetiformis: A rash that some people with celiac disease can get Impetigo: A skin infection caused by bacteria Insect bites: Sometimes, they can look like shingles Folliculitis: The tiny holes that hairs grow out of can get inflamed Scabies: A skin condition caused by a small bug called a mite One way to tell shingles from these conditions is by the other symptoms that come with it."
What does a shingles rash look like?,"A shingles rash: Appears on one side of your body and/or face Stings, burns, and/or itches Starts as red bumps that form into blisters Other conditions also cause rashes that look like shingles."
How can I treat allergy symptoms?,"For mild allergy symptoms, such as hay fever or hives, give an over-the-counter ( OTC) antihistamine. For stuffy nose, give an OTC decongestant. For itchy, watery eyes, use OTC allergy eye drops. For itchy allergic rash, apply cold compresses and an OTC hydrocortisone cream."
Where is the sentinel node located in breast cancer?,"In breast cancer, the sentinel node is usually located in the axillary nodes, under the arm. In a small percentage of cases, the sentinel node is found somewhere else in the lymphatic system of the breast. If the sentinel node is positive, there may be other positive lymph nodes upstream. If it is negative, it is highly likely that all of the upstream nodes are negative."
What does a sentinel node biopsy do for breast cancer?,"In breast cancer, a sentinel node biopsy pinpoints the first few lymph nodes into which a tumor drains (called the ""sentinel"" node). This helps doctors remove only those nodes of the lymphatic system most likely to contain cancer cells. The sentinel nodes are the first place that cancer is likely to spread."
How is a sentinel node biopsy done?,"To locate the sentinel nodes, a labeling substance, either a radioactive tracer, blue dye, or both, is injected into the area around the tumor before a mastectomy or lumpectomy is performed. The tracer travels the same path to the lymph nodes that the cancer cells would take, making it possible for the surgeon to determine the one or two nodes most likely to test positive for cancer by either visualizing the color or using a handheld Geiger counter."
How can sickle cell disease affect your immune system?,"Sickle cells can damage your spleen, the organ that helps fight germs as part of your immune system. That can make you more likely to get pneumonia and other infections."
What is sickle cell crisis?,It happens when you don't have enough red blood cells to move oxygen throughout your body.
Which vaccines should I get if I have sickle cell disease?,"Vaccines can protect you and your child against germs. Everyone with sickle cell disease should get these vaccines: Pneumococcus: both the PCV13 and PPSV 23 vaccines Flu vaccine every year Meningococcus Your doctor will also advise you about other vaccines that may be right for you or your child, including: Hepatitis A and B Measles, mumps, and rubella Varicella (chickenpox) Rotavirus Haemophilus influenzae Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis Poliovirus When sickle cells get stuck in the larger arteries that feed the brain, they can block blood flow and cause a stroke."
How can hydroxyurea help treat sickle cell disease?,"A medicine called hydroxyurea ( Droxia, Hydrea, Sikos) prevents abnormal red blood cells from forming. This cuts down on episodes of sickle cell crises. Hydroxyurea can cause serious side effects, like a plunge in the number of white blood cells that help your body fight infections. So your doctor will watch you closely while you're on it. You shouldn't take hydroxyurea if you're pregnant."
How can sickle cell disease lead to stroke?,"Everyone with sickle cell disease should get these vaccines: Pneumococcus: both the PCV13 and PPSV 23 vaccines Flu vaccine every year Meningococcus Your doctor will also advise you about other vaccines that may be right for you or your child, including: Hepatitis A and B Measles, mumps, and rubella Varicella (chickenpox) Rotavirus Haemophilus influenzae Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis Poliovirus When sickle cells get stuck in the larger arteries that feed the brain, they can block blood flow and cause a stroke. You can preventfrequent transfusions can lower the odds of another stroke by about 90% If you think you're having a stroke, call 911 right away."
Which medicines can help treat long-term pain from sickle cell disease?,"If you have long-term pain, your doctor might prescribe one of these medicines: Amitriptyline Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Gabapentin ( Horizant, Gralise, Neurontin) Opioid pain medicine It's a serious condition that can land you in the hospital."
What is the best way to prevent colds?,It's all due to the way colds spread.
How are colds passed?,"The main way colds get passed around is when someone who's sick coughs or sneezes. Little droplets with germs land on places like doorknobs, telephones, and computer keyboards. Or the sick person coughs or sneezes into their hands and then touches those objects. Then you come along, happy and healthy, and touch that spot. Next, without even realizing it, you might touch your nose and mouth. Voila! In an instant you're infected."
How should I wash my hands for cold prevention?,"Here's the drill: First, wet your hands with water. Then add soap. Rub them together vigorously for 20 seconds. Make sure to rub the wrists, between the fingers, and under the fingernails. When you have time, use a nailbrush, as germs often hide under nails. Rinse your hands thoroughly and dry with a clean paper towel or air dryer. If you are in a public restroom, shut the faucet off with a paper towel. Try to push the door open with your shoulder, or use another paper towel to turn the knob."
Does hand sanitizer prevent colds?,"It should be at least 60% alcohol. Rub the entire surface of your hands, fingers, and wrist with the sanitizer until dry. You can use this throughout the day if you're not near a bathroom. Follow up with a thorough hand scrub when you're near a sink to prevent buildup of the sanitizer."
Why does hand washing prevent colds?,"Some viruses -- tiny living things that cause colds -- can live on surfaces for hours. Regular hand washing is your best strategy to keep them from getting inside your body. And of course, if you're the one who's sick, washing up will keep you from spreading your germs. There's some evidence behind this. A program called Operation Stop Cough was started at a military recruit training command center in Illinois. As part of the program, recruits were told to wash their hands at least five times a day. After 2 years, the hand-washing team reported 45% fewer cases of respiratory illness, compared with sickness rates among recruits during the year before the program started."
What are drugs used to prevent tooth decay in dentistry?,Fluoride is a drug used to prevent tooth decay. It is available on a nonprescription basis in many toothpastes. It is absorbed by teeth and helps strengthen teeth to resist acid and block the cavity-forming action of bacteria.
What drugs are used to treat periodontal disease?,The doxycycline periodontal system (marketed as Atridox) contains the antibiotic doxycycline and is used to help treat periodontal disease.

The older, over-the-counter antihistamines, including diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine ( Chlor- Trimeton), might not be the best choices for postnasal drip. When they dry out mucus, they can actually thicken it. Newer antihistamines like loratadine ( Claritin, Alavert), fexofenadine ( Allegra), cetirizine ( Zyrtec), levocetirizine ( Xyzal), and desloratadine ( Clarinex), may be better options and are less likely to cause drowsiness. It's a good idea to check with your doctor before taking these because all of them can have side effects that range from dizziness to dry mouth."

Swallowing problems can cause a buildup of liquids in the throat, which can feel like postnasal drip. These problems can sometimes occur with age, a blockage, or conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD."
How can you reduce triggers of postnasal drip?,"You can also try propping up your pillows at night so that the mucus doesn't pool or collect in the back of your throat. If you have allergies, here are some other ways to reduce your triggers: Cover your mattresses and pillowcases with dust mite proof covers. Wash all sheets, pillowcases, and mattress covers often in hot water. Use special HEPA air filters in your home. These can remove very fine particles from the air. Dust and vacuum regularly."

You might have a bacterial infection. Let your doctor know right away if you notice blood in your postnasal drip. If medication doesn't relieve your symptoms, you might need to see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (also called an otolaryngologist) for evaluation. Your doctor might want you to get a CT scan, X-rays, or other tests."
What are other methods to treat postnasal drip?,"Other methods you can try include: Take a medication such as guaifenesin ( Mucinex). Use saline nasal sprays or irrigation, like a neti pot, to flush mucus, bacteria, allergens, and other irritating things out of the sinuses. Turn on a vaporizer or humidifier to increase the moisture in the air."
How do you treat postnasal drip?,"How you treat postnasal drip depends on what's causing it. Antibiotics can clear up a bacterial infection. However, green or yellow mucus is not proof of a bacterial infection. Colds can also turn the mucus these colors, and they are caused by viruses, which don't respond to antibiotics."
What is postnasal drip?,"Your nose alone makes about a quart of it each day. Mucus is a thick, wet substance that moistens these areas and helps trap and destroy foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses before they cause infection. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Normally, you don't notice the mucus from your nose because it mixes with saliva, drips harmlessly down the back of your throat, and you swallow it. When your body produces more mucus than usual or it's thicker than normal, it becomes more noticeable. The excess can come out of the nostrils -- that's a runny nose. When the mucus runs down the back of your nose to your throat, it's called postnasal drip."
How do doctors choose breast cancer treatments?,"Your doctor will think about many things before she recommends treatments for you, including: The type of breast cancer you have How fast it's growing Your age and how healthy you are If you've had breast cancer before If your tumor has female hormones or other genetic factors, such as the HER2 oncogene, that make it grow faster."

If you have the less serious blockage in the smaller arteries, your vision may go back to normal about 80% of the time."
How can optical coherence tomography help in the diagnosis of eye stroke?,"You get drops to dilate your pupils. Then a machine scans your eyes to make a detailed image of the retina. If your doctor thinks a clot from another part of the body caused the blockage, she may suggest other tests to look for problems in your arteries and heart. She also may order blood tests to check for clotting disorders and your cholesterol levels."
How can paracentesis help treat eye stroke?,"A specialist uses a small needle to remove a few drops of fluid from the front of your eye. This reduces pressure, which may increase blood flow in the retina."

Are there ways to get pregnant that bypass the fallopian tubes?,"Once you begin to successfully ovulate, your doctor may suggest trying artificial insemination, in which sperm is inserted directly into your uterus. Keep in mind that some standard treatments for endometriosis can either prevent pregnancy or, in the case of the hormone Danocrine, cause serious birth defects. Make sure your doctor knows that you are trying to conceive if you're being treated for endometriosis."
How do problems with the fallopian tubes affect fertility?,"Problems with the fallopian tubes also account for a significant percentage of infertility cases. Sometimes, the tubes may be blocked or they may be scarred as a result of disease or infection. When an egg is released from one of the ovaries, it travels through one of the fallopian tubes, which are narrow ducts that connect the ovaries to the uterus. Normally, the egg will join with the sperm in the fallopian tubes during conception and the now-fertilized egg will continue on to the uterus. However, the fallopian tubes are extremely fragile. If they are blocked, there's no way for the egg to become fertilized by the sperm."
Should I let my doctor know if I'm trying to conceive while being treated for endometriosis?,"Keep in mind that some standard treatments for endometriosis can either prevent pregnancy or, in the case of the hormone Danocrine, cause serious birth defects. Make sure your doctor knows that you are trying to conceive if you're being treated for endometriosis."
How do I find out if my fallopian tubes are blocked?,"To determine whether your fallopian tubes are blocked, your doctor may suggest a laparoscopy or a hysterosalpingogram ( HSG). In an HSG test, liquid dye is inserted by catheter through the vagina (cervix) into the uterus. Then, X-rays are taken to see if there is a blockage or if the dye flows freely into the abdomen. Another method of HSG uses saline and air rather than dye and ultrasound instead of X-ray. If you have problems with your fallopian tubes, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct the damage or unblock the tubes."
How does endometriosis affect your menstrual cycle?,"The problem is that this tissue behaves like normal endometrial tissue -- it builds up and breaks down with your menstrual cycle -- but it can't be shed like normal endometrial tissue during your period. As a result, the rogue tissue causes irritation and inflammation. This buildup of tissue can prevent the eggs from getting out of the ovaries or being fertilized by sperm. It can also scar and block the fallopian tubes, preventing the egg and sperm from meeting."

An injury to your jaw or an infection in your mouth also might raise your risk. And scientists think some viruses or a lack of protein or minerals in your diet may be linked to them as well."
How are ameloblastomas treated?,"Drugs and radiation don't seem to have much effect on most non-cancerous ameloblastomas, so they're usually treated with surgery."
How are ameloblastomas diagnosed?,"Dentists often spot these tumors on X-rays -- they can look like soap bubbles on film. They also can be diagnosed with the following: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make images of your mouth. CT (computerized tomography) scan: Several X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to show more detailed information. Your doctor may want to take a small sample of tissue to look at under a microscope. To take the sample, he'll use a needle or make a small cut. This is called a biopsy, and it can confirm it's an ameloblastoma and help determine how fast it's growing."

What is angioplasty and stenting for angina?,"This could be: Angioplasty /stenting: The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, he inflates the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. A small tube called a stent may be left inside the artery to help keep it open. The stent is usually permanent and made of metal. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You'll probably stay overnight at the hospital."
What do medicines for angina do?,"Your doctor might prescribe medicines to: Widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to the heart Slow the heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard Relax blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart Prevent blood clots If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery."

Some pill packs don't have any placebo pills, so it's best to take all of your pills on schedule so you can stay on track."
Does radon gas cause lung cancer?,"Radon gas Radon gas is a natural, chemically inert gas that is a natural decay product of uranium. It decays to form products that emit a type of ionizing radiation. Radon gas is a known cause of lung cancer, with an estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon gas, or 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer-related deaths annually in the U. S. As with asbestos exposure, concomitant smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure. Radon gas can travel up through soil and enter homes through gaps in the foundation, pipes, drains, or other openings. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that one out of every 15 homes in the U. S. contains dangerous levels of radon gas. Radon gas is invisible and odorless, but can be detected with simple test kits."
How can smoking affect your risk of getting lung cancer?,"Smoking The incidence of lung cancer is strongly correlated with cigarette smoking, with about 90% of lung cancers arising as a result of tobacco use. The risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked over time; doctors refer to this risk in terms of pack-years of smoking history (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked). For example, a person who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history. While the risk of lung cancer is increased with even a 10 pack-year smoking history, those with 30 pack-year histories or more are considered to have the greatest risk for the development of lung cancer. Among those who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes per day, one in seven will die of lung cancer. But even though the risk is higher the more you smoke, there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke."

The risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked over time; doctors refer to this risk in terms of pack-years of smoking history (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked). For example, a person who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history. While the risk of lung cancer is increased with even a 10 pack-year smoking history, those with 30 pack-year histories or more are considered to have the greatest risk for the development of lung cancer. Among those who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes per day, one in seven will die of lung cancer. But even though the risk is higher the more you smoke, there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke."
Does pipe and cigar smoking cause lung cancer?,"Pipe and cigar smoking can also cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with cigarettes. While someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar smokers have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker."
How can pipe and cigar smoking affect your risk of getting lung cancer?,"Pipe and cigar smoking can also cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with cigarettes. While someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar smokers have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker."
Do survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk of developing lung cancer?,"Prior history of lung cancer Survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk than the general population of developing a second lung cancer. Survivors of non-small cell lung cancers have an added risk of 1%-2% per year for developing a second lung cancer. In survivors of small cell lung cancers, the risk for development of second cancers approaches 6% per year."
Is there a familial predisposition to lung cancer?,"Familial predisposition While the majority of lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, the fact that not all smokers eventually develop lung cancer suggests that other factors, such as individual genetic susceptibility, may play a role in the causation of lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population."
How can tobacco smoke affect your risk of getting lung cancer?,"Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemical compounds, many of which have been shown to be cancer-causing, or carcinogenic. The two primary carcinogens in tobacco smoke are chemicals known as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The risk of developing lung cancer decreases each year following smoking cessation as normal cells grow and replace damaged cells in the lung. In former smokers, the risk of developing lung cancer begins to approach that of a nonsmoker about 15 years after cessation of smoking."
How can passive smoking affect your risk for lung cancer?,"Passive smoking Passive smoking, or the inhalation of secondhand tobacco smoke from other smokers sharing living or working quarters, is also an established risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung cancer when compared with other nonsmokers. An estimated 7,300 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U. S. that are attributable to passive smoking."
How can familial predisposition affect your risk for lung cancer?,"Familial predisposition While the majority of lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, the fact that not all smokers eventually develop lung cancer suggests that other factors, such as individual genetic susceptibility, may play a role in the causation of lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population."
How can asbestos fibers affect your risk for lung cancer?,"Asbestos fibers Asbestos fibers are silicate fibers that can persist for a lifetime in lung tissue following exposure to asbestos. The workplace is a common source of exposure to asbestos fibers, as asbestos was widely used in the past for both thermal and acoustic insulation materials. Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries including the Unites States. Both lung cancer and mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in exposed workers. Asbestos workers who do not smoke have a fivefold greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smokers, and those asbestos workers who smoke have a risk that is 50 to 90 times greater than non-smokers."
Does lung disease cause lung cancer?,"Lung disease The presence of certain diseases of the lung, notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD), is associated with a slightly increased risk (four to six times the risk of a nonsmoker) for the development of lung cancer even after the effects of concomitant cigarette smoking are excluded."

The skills you'll learn can last a lifetime, so this is a powerful treatment method. But not all therapists are trained in cognitive behavioral therapy techniques."
What happens to children with conduct disorder?,"These include antisocial and other personality disorders, mood or anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Children with conduct disorder are also at risk for school-related problems, such as failing or dropping out, substance abuse, legal problems, injuries to self or others due to violent behavior, sexually transmitted diseases, and suicide. Treatment outcomes can vary greatly, but early intervention may help to reduce the risk for incarcerations, mood disorders, and the development of other comorbidities such as substance abuse."
What causes conduct disorder?,"The exact cause of conduct disorder is not known, but it is believed that a combination of biological, genetic, environmental, psychological, and social factors play a role."
Can a troubled family or social life cause conduct disorder?,"Environmental: Factors such as a dysfunctional family life, childhood abuse, traumatic experiences, a family history of substance abuse, and inconsistent discipline by parents may contribute to the development of conduct disorder. Psychological: Some experts believe that conduct disorders can reflect problems with moral awareness (notably, lack of guilt and remorse) and deficits in cognitive processing. Social: Low socioeconomic status and not being accepted by their peers appear to be risk factors for the development of conduct disorder."
Is conduct disorder inherited?,"Genetics: Many children and teens with conduct disorder have close family members with mental illnesses, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders. This suggests that a vulnerability to conduct disorder may be at least partially inherited."
How can I tell if my cat is purring because of affection?,Kittens can purr when they're only a few days old. It's probably a way to let their mothers know where they are or that they're OK. Purring also helps a kitten bond with its mother. Mama cats use it like a lullaby.
How is a biopsy done to diagnose throat cancer?,"Common ones include: A biopsy collects a tissue sample that gets examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. It's the only way to know for sure if a tumor is cancer and what kind it is.

What do I need to know about periorbital cellulitis?,"Adults can get it, but children under 2 are most likely to have it. It happens when bacteria attack the soft tissue around your eye, including your eyelid. These germs can get into your skin through a cut or scratch, or they can get to the area through an infection in your sinuses. It also can be a reaction to a stye (a tender bump on your eyelid that forms when a gland on your eyelid gets infected). Periorbital cellulitis is sometimes called preseptal cellulitis because it happens outside a part of your skull called the orbital septum. A layer of tissue keeps the infection from spreading to your eye, so it usually doesn't affect your vision."
What are symptoms of periorbital cellulitis?,"The most common signs of periorbital cellulitis are: Redness and swelling around the eye A cut, scratch, or insect bite near the eye The skin in the affected area is tender to the touch and might feel a little tough. The white of the eye might look red. Periorbital cellulitis doesn't cause a fever or pain. If you or your child has a fever and swelling and it hurts to move the affected eye, get medical help right away. These things can be caused by a more serious condition called orbital cellulitis that affects the eye itself."

What does the liver do?,"Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver."
What increases risk for liver cancer?,"Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Aflatoxins, cancer-causing substances made by a type of plant mold, have also been implicated. Aflatoxins can contaminate wheat, peanuts, rice, corn, and soybeans. These are rare problems in most developed countries like the U. S. Other causes include the hormones androgen and estrogen and a dye formerly used in medical tests called thorotrast."
What is primary liver cancer and how common is it?,"Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver. Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic, meaning it started elsewhere in the body. Primary liver cancer, which starts in the liver, accounts for about 2% of cancers in the U. S., but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries. This is mainly due to the prevalence of hepatitis, caused by contagious viruses, that predisposes a person to liver cancer. In the U. S., primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women, at an average age of 67."
What are the risk factors for liver cancer?,"Other risk factors for liver cancer may include: Your sex. Men are more likely to get hepatocellular carcinoma than women. Your weight.

What are the symptoms of thrombocytopenia?,"Sometimes you don't have any symptoms from thrombocytopenia. When you do, the main one is bleeding in the skin that look like tiny red or purple spots on the skin, called petechiae, or bruising. You can bleed outside or inside your body. Sometimes it can be heavy or hard to stop. Some people get nosebleeds or bleeding gums. You might also have: Blood in your urine or bowel movement Heavy menstrual periods These symptoms might not start until your platelet count is very low. If you notice any of them, call your doctor."
What factors lead to thrombocytopenia?,"Your body can destroy too many platelets by: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP), where your own body attacks healthy cells Medicines, such as antibiotics that contain sulfa, heparin used to prevent blood clots, and antiseizure drugs such as phenytoin ( Dilantin) and vancomycin ( Vancocin) Rare diseases that make blood clots form in the body, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC) Viruses like Epstein- Barr virus ( EBV), hepatitis C, and HIV Sometimes, you don't have enough platelets because they get trapped in your spleen, an organ that fights infection. And women may get thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, because their bodies get rid of platelets more quickly than usual."
How is thrombocytopenia diagnosed?,"You'll also get an exam to look for bruises, petechiae or spots of blood in your skin, and other signs of low platelets. You'll be checked for signs of infection, like a fever or rash. You might get a blood test that measures the number of platelets. A normal count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. You can have bleeding problems if your count drops below 50,000. Your doctor will most likely consult with a blood specialist (hematologist). You might get other tests, including: Blood smear to look at your platelets under a microscope and see how healthy they are Bone marrow test to see what cells are in the bone marrow, how full the bone marrow is with cells, and whether they are normall Your doctor might want you to take other tests that check if your blood clots normally."
How can you prevent bleeding if you have thrombocytopenia?,"To prevent bleeding when your platelets are low: Avoid medicines that can affect your platelet function, like aspirin and ibuprofen Limit how much alcohol you drink, because it can make bleeding worse. Don't play contact sports, like football or boxing, where you might get injured. Use a soft toothbrush to prevent bleeding gums.

Most often, it's the bladder that gets infected. It can be painful, but not usually too serious. But if those bacteria travel up the ureters, you can have a much more serious problem: a kidney infection. Doctors sometimes call this âpyelonephritis.â You need to have a kidney infection treated right away. If you don't, it can lead to life-threatening problems."
Who can get a kidney infection?,"But just as women get more bladder infections than men, they also get more kidney infections. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's closer to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. That means it's easier for bacteria to get into a woman's urethra, and once they do, it's a shorter trip to the bladder. From there, they can spread to the kidneys.

How effective Is clot-busting medicine for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"Your doctor may recommend a clot-busting medicine called a thrombolytic agent if you: Have large clots causing pain, swelling, and problems with circulation Are at high risk for a pulmonary embolism Have DVT in your arm, rather than your leg This procedure quickly breaks up a clot and restores blood flow. It may also save the valves in that vein. But it's riskier than taking blood thinners. You have a greater chance of bleeding problems and stroke."
When is surgery done for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"When taking blood thinners or clot-busting isn't possible or doesn't work well, your doctor may want to try a more involved procedure."
How are blood thinners used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"These drugs, also called anticoagulants, are the most common treatment for DVT. They can keep a clot from growing or breaking off, and they prevent new clots from forming. But they can't thin your blood, despite their name, or dissolve an existing clot."
How is dabigatran used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,Dabigatran is a pill that stops a specific protein that helps your blood clot from working. That's why it's called a direct thrombin inhibitor.
What causes bradycardia?,"The abnormal rhythm can show up after a heart attack or as a side effect of heart surgery. Other things that can lead to it: Certain medications, such as those to treat high blood pressure and other arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats A congenital defect, or problem you're born with Thyroid disease, an imbalance of hormones in the body Obstructive sleep apnea , when your breathing pauses many times throughout the night Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it's not always present all the time."
What tests are done to diagnose bradycardia?,"Other things that can lead to it: Certain medications, such as those to treat high blood pressure and other arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats A congenital defect, or problem you're born with Thyroid disease, an imbalance of hormones in the body Obstructive sleep apnea , when your breathing pauses many times throughout the night Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it's not always present all the time. Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you're having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it's a way to measure your heart's electrical system. If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you've had."
What are the symptoms of bradycardia?,"The biggest concern is your heart isn't doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: Lightheadedness or dizziness Confusion or a hard time concentrating Fainting Shortness of breath (with or without chest pain) You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity."
What are the treatments for bradycardia?,"If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism, or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug. If these approaches don't work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker."
When should you see a doctor for bradycardia?,"If you or a loved one faints, has chest pains or trouble breathing, call 911. Tiredness, trouble concentrating, or breathing harder may just seem like part of growing older. But sometimes it's more than that. Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms. If you wear out more easily now than you did a month or year ago, let her know."
How can isometrics help you deal with arthritis?,"Some people with arthritis avoid exercise because of joint pain. However, a group of exercises called ""isometrics"" will help strengthen muscles without bending painful joints. Isometrics involve no joint movement but rather strengthen muscle groups by using an alternating series of isolated muscle flexes and periods of relaxation."
How can exercising help with treating arthritis?,"Exercise, as part of a comprehensive arthritis treatment plan, can improve joint mobility, muscle strength, and overall physical conditioning, and help you maintain a healthy weight. Once you know what type of arthritis you have and understand your symptoms, you and your doctor or physical therapist can develop a balanced program of physical activity to reduce the damaging effects of arthritis and promote optimal health."
What do I need to know about thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)?,"If you have thrombocytopenia, you don't have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets help your blood clot, which stops bleeding. For most people, it's not a big problem. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed spontaneously in your eyes, gums, or bladder or bleed too much when you're injured. A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 400,000. You have thrombocytopenia if your number falls under 150,000."

"How do I treat bee, wasp, and other insect stings?","Here's what to do: If the insect has left behind a stinger, remove it from the skin so less of the venom gets into your body. You can scrape out the stinger with the edge of a credit card or the dull edge of a knife. Don't squeeze the stinger. You might release more of the venom into your skin. Once the stinger is out or if there is no stinger, wash the area around the sting with soap and water. Hold an ice pack or cool washcloth to the sting to stop it from swelling. Spread calamine lotion or baking soda mixed with water to relieve pain. To prevent itching, use a spray or cream containing hydrocortisone or antihistamine."

The disease is rare in infants and adults."
What should I know about fifth disease?,"It poses little risk to healthy children and adults, with a couple of exceptions: pregnant women and people with certain types of chronic anemia. If a pregnant woman is infected in the first half of her pregnancy, there is a small risk of severe anemia in the fetus and a 10% risk of miscarriage. Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19 and is spread by respiratory secretions from an infected person. By the time the rash appears, children are no longer contagious and may attend school or day care."
How can counseling help treat migraines?,"In acceptance and commitment therapy ( ACT), you accept that you have some migraine pain instead of trying to control it completely or avoid it. You commit to âgrow awayâ from a focus on migraines to discover goals and values you want more of in your life. And then you take action toward those goals."
How can sphenopalatine ganglion nerve block help treat migraines?,"This short, simple procedure numbs the SPG, a group of nerve cells inside and behind your nose. The FDA has approved three devices for doing this. It works because your SPG is linked to your trigeminal nerve, which is involved in these headaches. You get the procedure in your doctor's office. You'll be awake for it. Your doctor will insert a thin plastic tube, called a catheter, into your nose, one nostril at a time. Through an attached syringe, you'll get an anesthetic to numb your SPG and the area around it. Your doctor may use an X-ray machine to be sure the tube is inserted correctly. Once the numbness wears off, you may still feel relief for some time."

How can calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors help in treating migraine?,"CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) was the first medicine specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. In 2018, fremanezumab ( Ajovy) was also aproved. With each, you give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device."
How do checkpoint inhibitors work?,"They help the immune system tell if other cells are a normal part of your body and should be left alone or invaders that should be attacked. Cancer cells can trick your immune system by binding to the cells that are supposed to fight it. When that happens, the checkpoint signals your body not to attack. A checkpoint inhibitor stops these cells from binding. That way, your immune system recognizes and targets the cancer."
How can immunotherapy drugs treat metastatic bladder cancer?,"Your immune system is designed to fight infection and diseases, including cancer. But cancer cells can grow unchecked because they avoid your body's defenses. Immunotherapy drugs work by making cancer cells easier targets or by boosting the immune system to make it more effective against the disease."
How should I eat if I have dumping syndrome?,"Here are some other ways to lessen symptoms of dumping syndrome: Eat five or six small meals or snacks a day. Keep portions small, such as 1 ounce of meat or 1/4 cup of vegetables. Cut food into very small pieces. Chew well before swallowing. Combine proteins or fats along with fruits or starches.

Reclining after eating may help prevent light-headedness."
How is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs) diagnosed?,"No one test can identify a case of ARDS. It's more of a puzzle that a doctor has to piece together. Other conditions can have similar symptoms. To make a diagnosis, you doctor will probably begin by asking about your medical history. She'll then likely do a physical exam and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. She may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin There are various tests your doctor might order to help her reach a diagnosis."
How can you treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Treatment aims to get oxygen levels in your blood back up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. Doctors might start with an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), depending on exactly what you need. Other treatments might include: Nutrition and medicine through IV fluids Medicine to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medicine to keep you calm and comfortable People with ARDS are treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital."
What happens when you have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and builds up in the tiny air sacs in your lungs. Your lungs are then unable to fill up with enough air. Because of this, the blood traveling to your lungs can't pick up the amount of oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. That can lead to organs such as your kidneys or brain not working as they should or shutting down. Doctors aren't sure why some people get ARDS and others don't."
What tests are used to diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,She may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin There are various tests your doctor might order to help her reach a diagnosis. Some of them include: Scans: A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also get a computerized tomography ( CT) scan. These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is located. Blood tests: These can be used to check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia. Heart tests: These might be ordered to rule out things such as heart failure (when your heart doesn't pump blood to your body properly).
What are the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Some of the other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that requires a blood transfusion Inflammation of the pancreas Overdosing on cocaine and other drugs Near drowning Burns ARDS makes it hard to breathe and puts great strain on the lungs. So symptoms include shortness of breath, often severe. Other signs of ARDS include: Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in the blood Dizziness Lots of sweating While many people are already in a hospital when they get ARDS, you should get medical treatment at once if you have these symptoms or see them in a loved one."
What causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Doctors are still trying to learn more about this condition and why it happens. It's not always clear what triggers a case. Most people who get ARDS are already in the hospital for something else. That's because it's usually caused by an injury or another illness. Some of the causes of ARDS may include: Sepsis: This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream, and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation, small blood clots, and bleeding. Accidents: Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or that part of your brain that handles breathing. Breathing in harmful substances: Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS."
What are some reasons for sleeping disorder?,"But it can be due to obstructive sleep apnea, which causes people to stop breathing briefly during sleep. Likewise, insomnia often happens for simple reasons, like stress or jet lag."

What are feeding tips for a baby?,"Continue to feed your baby when she wants to be fed, about 7 to 8 times a day. Your baby may be going longer between feedings and have fewer poopy diapers, and that's okay. Spitting up is common. Holding your baby upright in your arms, in a swing, or in a car seat for about 30 minutes after feeding may help. Make sure you continue to burp her after each feeding. Don't give your baby infant cereal, juice, or other solids yet. Her digestive system is not ready. And NO water. Breast milk or formula is all your baby needs right now!"
What are the combination immunizations your baby will get at the 2-month checkup?,"These may include: DTa P (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) Hib (haemophilus influenzae type b) IPV (polio vaccine) PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) HBV (hepatitis B) RV (rotavirus) Remember, these vaccines are safe, and your baby really needs them to protect her from many life-threatening illnesses, such as pertussis or whooping cough."

Still, like all drugs, they can cause side effects. These include feeling depressed and having problems during sex. You may not be able to take beta-blockers if you have asthma or diabetes. Your doctor may suggest a different type of preventive medicine if you have certain types of migraines with auras. These medicines were thought to increase stroke risk with this type of migraine, though the proof is very scant."
How can botulinum toxin (Botox) help prevent chronic migraine?,"Long used to fill wrinkles, this nerve toxin has been found to stave off chronic migraines. It prevents a pain network in your brain from turning on. But it's only approved for people who have headaches at least 15 days each month. The more frequent your migraines, the better Botox seems to help. You may need several treatments before it starts to work."
What is mastitis?,"Mastitis is an infection of the tissue of the breast that occurs most frequently during the time of breastfeeding. It can occur when bacteria, often from the baby's mouth, enter a milk duct through a crack in the nipple.

Pus draining from the nipple Persistent fever and no improvement of symptoms within 48-72 hours of treatment Call your health care provider as soon as you feel any suspicious lump, whether you are breastfeeding or not."
When should you go to the ER for a breast infection?,"You may need to be evaluated in a hospital's emergency department if the breast pain is associated with other signs of an infection (such as a fever, swelling, or redness to the breast) and if your health care provider cannot see you promptly. The below symptoms require emergency treatment: A persistent high fever greater than 101.5 ° F Nausea or vomiting that is preventing you from taking the antibiotics as prescribed Pus draining from the breast Red streaks extending toward your arm or chest Dizziness, fainting, or confusion The diagnosis of mastitis and a breast abscess can usually be made based on a physical exam."

Why do people get tonsillectomy?,"In the last 30 years, although tonsillectomy is frequently performed for recurrent infections, the most common reason for removing tonsils is tonsil-enlargement (hypertrophy) causing obstructive symptoms such as snoring, sleep apnea, and difficulty swallowing."
What is different about breast cancer in younger women?,"Diagnosing breast cancer in women under 40 years old is more difficult, because their breast tissue is generally denser than in older women. By the time a lump in a younger woman's breast can be felt, the cancer may be advanced. In addition, breast cancer in younger women can be aggressive and less likely to respond to treatment. Women who are diagnosed at a younger age also are more likely to have a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Delays in diagnosing breast cancer can cause problems. Many younger women ignore the warning signs -- such as a breast lump or unusual nipple discharge -- because they believe they're too young to get breast cancer. They may assume a lump is a harmless cyst or other growth. Some doctors may also dismiss breast lumps in young women as cysts."
What are the treatment options for breast cancer in younger women?,"Treatment options include: Surgery: either a lumpectomy, which involves removing the tumor and some surrounding tissue, or a mastectomy, which is the removal of a breast. Radiation is generally used following a lumpectomy, and chemotherapyand hormone therapy often are recommended after surgery to help destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent a return. Breast cancer treatment can affect your sexuality, fertility, and pregnancy. If you'd like to have children, talk to your doctor it before you begin treatment."
How are treatment decisions for breast cancer in young women made?,"Treatment decisions are made based whether or not it has spread beyond the breast, as well as the woman's general health and personal circumstances."

Should women under age 40 get mammograms?,"In general, regular mammograms aren't recommended for women under 40 years of age, in part because breast tissue tends to be dense, making mammograms less effective. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 40 to 44 should have a choice to start yearly screening mammograms if they would like. Women ages 45 through 54 should have a mammogram each year and those 55 years and over should continue getting mammograms every 1 to 2 years.. Most experts believe the low risk at that age doesn't justify the exposure to radiation or the cost of mammography. But mammograms may be recommended for younger women with a family history of breast cancer and other risk factors."
Should I heat baby formula?,There's no need to heat the formula for your baby. Drinking it at room temperature is fine.
Is it OK to bottle-feed your baby?,"Infant formulas have gotten better and better at matching the ingredients and their proportions to that of human milk. While breastfed babies may have relatively fewer infections, the vast majority of infants won't get a serious infection in the first months whether breast- or bottle fed. A happy, unstressed mother is the best mother. If you feel that bottle feeding best fits your needs, then it's the best for meeting your baby's needs as well."
Can I use leftover baby formula?,"Once a baby has sipped from formula, it should be discarded. You can, though, save unused formula that baby hasn't sipped from for the next feeding."
Are there side effects of corticosteroids used to treat psoriasis?,"Whether you get them depends a lot on the strength of the corticosteroid, how large an area you spread it on, and how long you use it. To lower your risk, your doctor may look for the weakest one that can get the job done in the shortest time. Some common side effects that could happen to you: Thinning of your skin Changes in skin coloring You bruise easily Stretch marks Skin gets reddish Broken blood vessels Increased hair growth in localized areas Infections You become sensitive to light Corticosteroids can be absorbed through your skin and sometimes cause health problems such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and a hormonal problem called Cushing's syndrome."
When are weaker coricosteroids best to treat psoriasis?,"Weaker corticosteroids are best if you need to use it on sensitive areas such as your face, groin, or breasts. Your doctor may also prescribe a lower-strength version if you have to use it for a long time. Mild to mid-strength ones can be used for children."
When are stronger corticosteroids used to treat psoriasis?,"You may need a stronger one if you have a severe form of psoriasis. It's also a good choice for spots with thicker skin, such as your palms or the soles of your feet."
How are shin splints treated?,"Rest your body. It needs time to heal. Ice your shin to ease pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days, or until the pain is gone. Use insoles or orthotics for your shoes. Shoe inserts -- which can be custom-made or bought off the shelf -- may help if your arches collapse or flatten when you stand up. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers, if you need them. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, will help with pain and swelling."
What causes shin splints?,"This common problem can result from: Flat feet -- when the impact of a step makes your foot's arch collapse (your doctor will call this overpronation) Shoes that don't fit well or provide good support Working out without warmup or cooldown stretches Weak ankles, hips, or core muscles If you're active, you could get them if you make sudden changes like more intense, more frequent, or longer workouts."
How do I know if my shin splints are healed?,"Your injured leg feels as strong as your other leg. You can push hard on spots that used to be painful. You can jog, sprint, and jump without pain. There's no way to say exactly when your shin splints will go away. It depends on what caused them. People also heal at different rates; 3 to 6 months isn't unusual."
What can help with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)?,It can help with: Speech trouble Swallowing problems Daily activities at home and at work It's important to stay healthy overall no matter which type of MS you have.
How can diet and exercise help with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)?,"It can help with: Speech trouble Swallowing problems Daily activities at home and at work It's important to stay healthy overall no matter which type of MS you have. There are no specific eating plans that help with MS, but a nutritious diet is always best. You should also try to stay at a healthy weight. Exercise is also good for all types of MS. It can help you: Stay active and mobile Manage your symptoms Control your weight Exercise can also give you more energy and boost your mood. Try different types of physical activity, such as: Brisk walking, swimming, or other gentle activities that get your heart pumping Exercises to improve your range of motion Stretching and strengthening moves Start slowly. If you're sensitive to temperature, be careful not to get overheated. And never exercise until you're totally exhausted because it will take much longer to recover."
What are common symptoms of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)?,"If you have primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( PPMS), you probably first saw a doctor because your legs were weak or you had trouble walking. Those are the most common symptoms of this type of MS. Once it starts, PPMS gets worse over time."
Drugs help reduce what symptoms of multiple sclerosis?,"You'll take medications to help you with: Tight muscles Bladder and bowel problems Pain Fatigue You'll also get rehabilitation, such as physical, occupational, or speech therapy."

If you're sensitive to temperature, be careful not to get overheated. And never exercise until you're totally exhausted because it will take much longer to recover."
What are the symptoms of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)?,"This disease mainly affects the nerves in your spinal cord. The main symptoms often involve: Problems walking Weak, stiff legs Trouble with balance Other common symptoms include: Speech or swallowing issues Vision problems Fatigue and pain Bladder and bowel trouble Doctors think MS -- no matter which type you have -- happens when your body attacks itself."
How many people have primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)?,Only 10% to 15% of people with multiple sclerosis have this form. Those that do are usually diagnosed later in life than people with other types.
How does primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) develop over time?,"Those are the most common symptoms of this type of MS. Once it starts, PPMS gets worse over time. How fast that happens or how much disability it will cause varies a lot, so it's hard to predict. Unlike some other types of MS, you won't have relapses or remissions."
How is primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) diagnosed?,"It can be hard for doctors to diagnose PPMS. This complex disease is different for everyone who has it. You may have symptoms for a few years, but no major flares, before doctors can tell you're getting worse."
What types of exercise help treat multiple sclerosis?,"It can help you: Stay active and mobile Manage your symptoms Control your weight Exercise can also give you more energy and boost your mood. Try different types of physical activity, such as: Brisk walking, swimming, or other gentle activities that get your heart pumping Exercises to improve your range of motion Stretching and strengthening moves Start slowly."

How do other drugs or foods interact with anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,"Drug or food interactions: Since this spray has little or no effect beyond the area applied, it is unlikely to interact with other drugs."
How do anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays work?,"How anticholinergic nasal sprays work: When sprayed into each nostril, anticholinergic nasal sprays decrease secretions from the glands lining the nasal passage."
Who should not use anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,Who should not use these medications: Individuals who are allergic to any components of the nasal spray should not take this drug.
How should you use anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,Use: The usual dosage is 2 sprays in each nostril 2-3 times per day.
What are side effects of anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,"Side effects: Anticholinergic nasal sprays may cause an excessively dry nose, thereby causing nosebleeds or irritation."
What problems can I have from infection of ureaplasma urealyticum and ureaplasma parvum?,"During pregnancy, the bacteria can lead to infections in both the mother and the baby. Problems in newborn babies can include: Low birth weight Pneumonia Bacteria in the blood, called septicemia To diagnose a ureaplasma infection, your doctor can take a sample of fluid from: Blood Amniotic fluid Placental tissue Cervix Urethra Your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection."
"How does a person get mycoplasma hominis, a type of mycoplasma infection?","These bacteria live in the urinary tract and genitals of about half of all women and fewer men. But if you're in general good health, you don't have to worry. They rarely cause an infection. Women with a weakened immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- are most at risk. You can sometimes pick up this infection during sex. The bacteria can also pass from a mother to her baby during childbirth."
What is mycoplasma pneumoniae?,"There are about 200 types of mycoplasma bacteria, but most of them are harmless. The ones you may have to worry about are: Mycoplasma pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma hominis Ureaplasma urealyticum Ureaplasma parvum This type causes lung infections. About a third of people who get infected come down with a mild form of pneumonia called ""walking pneumonia."" Most people, especially children, will get ""tracheobronchitis,"" a fancy name for a chest cold. You can catch one of these infections when someone who is sick coughs or sneezes and sends droplets with the bacteria into the air."
What does it mean if I have a mycoplasma infection?,"They're caused by tiny living things called bacteria. Unlike other bacteria, the ones that lead to mycoplasma infections don't have cell walls. That's important because many antibiotics kill bacteria by weakening those walls. Since mycoplasma bacteria don't have them, some antibiotics, like penicillin, won't work against them. There are about 200 types of mycoplasma bacteria, but most of them are harmless."
What is recovery like in an endometrial ablation?,"It shouldn't take you long to heal from an ablation. Most women are back to their normal routine within a week. You may have some cramping and bleeding for a few days and a watery or bloody discharge for up to 3 weeks. It's also common to have nausea and an urge to pee for the first 24 hours. Your doctor will advise you not to have sex, use tampons, or douche for a few days. She may also put limits on your activity, like not lifting heavy things right away. If you need medicine for pain, ask your doctor which over-the-counter medicines are safe to take. Don't take aspirin. It could make you bleed more."
What are common procedures in an endometrial ablation?,"The most common are: Hydrothermal: Your doctor gently pumps fluid into your uterus, then heats it. After 10 minutes, this destroys your uterine lining. Balloon therapy: Your doctor guides a thin tube with a special balloon on the end into your uterus. Heated fluid fills the balloon, which then expands and breaks up the lining. High-energy radio waves: Your doctor puts electrical mesh into your uterus and expands it. Then energy and heat sent by strong radio waves damage the lining, which your doctor removes with suction. Freezing: A thin probe with a very cold tip freezes off the lining of your uterus. Your doctor may call this âcryoablation.â Microwave: A special wand applies microwave energy to your uterine lining, which destroys it. Electrical: Your doctor can use an electric current to destroy the lining of your uterus, but this method isn't as commonly used as the others."
Who gets an endometrial ablation?,"Endometrial ablation can put an end to heavy bleeding that gets in the way of your everyday life (maybe you need to change your tampon or pad every hour, or you bleed for more than a week). If your bleeding causes other health problems, like anemia, this procedure could also help."
Who shouldn't get an endometrial ablation?,"Still, endometrial ablation isn't right for everyone. If you're post-menopausal, you shouldn't have it done. It's also not a good idea if you have: Uterine, cervical, or endometrial cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) A vaginal or cervical infection A weak wall to your uterus An infection of the uterus A scar from a Caesarean section An intrauterine device ( IUD) A disorder of the uterus or endometrium You also shouldn't have endometrial ablation if you're pregnant or want a baby in the future. It will make it harder for you to get pregnant."
When should you call your doctor about endometrial ablation?,"If you have any of these signs, call your doctor right away: Strong-smelling discharge from your vagina Fever Chills Intense cramping or stomach pain Heavy bleeding or bleeding that doesn't stop 2 days after your ablation Trouble peeing The results of endometrial ablation don't always last. After a few years, your periods may start to get heavier and longer again. If so, let your doctor know. You may need a different treatment."
Why is rhinoplasty done?,"Types of rhinoplasty include: Removing a hump on the nose Straightening the bridge Reshaping the nose's tip Increasing or decreasing the size of the nostrils Correcting the nose after an injury Opening breathing passages Making the nose bigger or smaller Nose jobs can be done to change how you look or for medical reasons. For example, some people may need surgery to repair a problem with the cartilage that divides one nostril from the other. Others may just want to make their nose smaller."
What is rhinoplasty?,"Getting a ""nose job,"" which doctors call rhinoplasty, can be very simple or very complex. When done correctly by an experienced surgeon, it can make a big difference in how a person looks."
Where should I get rhinoplasty?,"It's best to have the procedure done in an accredited facility. If you have a complication, an experienced surgeon working with a well-trained team will be able to assess and correct the situation. You should talk to your surgeon in advance to describe your goals and learn about the risks and benefits."
What are risks of rhinoplasty?,"Any type of surgery has risks. These include bleeding, infection, and allergic reaction to anesthesia. Risks of rhinoplasty include: Numbness Nosebleeds Scarring at the base of the nose Bursting of small blood vessels on the skin's surface Swelling Permanent nerve damage Need for a second or third operation Before getting a nose job, teens and their parents or guardians should talk extensively with the surgeon and weigh all of the risks and benefits."
Should a teen get a nose job?,Teens should not have a nose job until the nose has reached its adult size. This normally happens at about age 15 or 16 for girls. It usually happens a year or so later for boys.
What are the types of rhinoplasty?,Types of rhinoplasty include: Removing a hump on the nose Straightening the bridge Reshaping the nose's tip Increasing or decreasing the size of the nostrils Correcting the nose after an injury Opening breathing passages Making the nose bigger or smaller Nose jobs can be done to change how you look or for medical reasons.
What is recovery from rhinoplasty like?,"After a nose job, recovery takes patience and support from family and friends. You will need to keep your head elevated for at least 24 hours after the operation. And there will be some pain and swelling (which can be managed with medication and cold compresses). Some people become discouraged with the swelling and how they look immediately after the operation. But when the swelling goes down, the redness disappears and the nose fully heals. This can take weeks, but most people like the results."
How is vaginismus related to painful intercourse treated?,"Vaginismus: Painful spasms of muscles at the opening of the vagina may be an involuntary but appropriate response to painful stimuli. These spasms may be due to several factors, including painful insertion, previous painful experiences, previous abuse, or an unresolved conflict regarding sexuality. For a woman with vaginismus, her doctor may recommend behavioral therapy, including vaginal relaxation exercises."
How is inadequate lubrication related to painful intercourse treated?,"Inadequate lubrication: Treatment of inadequate lubrication depends on the cause. Treatment options include water-soluble lubricants (for use with condoms; other types of lubricants may damage condoms) or other substances such as vegetable oils. If arousal does not take place, more extensive foreplay might be needed during sexual relations."
How is urethritis related to painful intercourse treated?,"Urethritis and urethral syndrome: With this condition, a woman may urinate frequently with urgency, pain, and difficulty, but a urinalysis can find no identifiable bacteria. These symptoms may be caused by chronic inflammation of the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the body), from muscle spasms, anxiety, low estrogen levels, or a combination of these causes. Using a special instrument, the doctor may dilate the urethra if it is narrowed. The doctor may prescribe low-dose antibiotics. At times, antidepressants and antispasmodics may also be prescribed."
What is the treatment for deep thrust pain during intercouse?,"Treatment for deep thrust pain includes two strategies: Checking for pelvic adhesions (tissue that has become stuck together, sometimes developing after surgery) that may cause pain with intercourse and surgically removing them. Checking for ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis, uterine prolapse, or retroversion of the uterus (uterus is tilted backward instead of forward)."
How is interstitial cystitis related to painful intercourse treated?,"A cystoscopy is a procedure to look inside the bladder and may distend (stretch) the bladder to examine the bladder wall. Cystoscopy often works to clear the condition. Other treatments include amitriptyline ( Elavil), nifedipine ( Procardia), pentosan polysulfate sodium ( Elmiron), or other prescription drugs. Other options include bladder washings with dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) or other agents or transcutaneous electric stimulation ( TENS) and acupuncture."
What is the use of nanomedicine in treating multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"In some cases, nanoparticles act as tiny cargo ships that carry medicine -- sometimes, to parts of the body drugs can't reach on their own. For example, they can cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of cells that protect your brain from possible danger -- but that also keep helpful MS drugs from getting through. Attaching MS drugs to nanoparticles may solve this problem. That's because certain nanoparticles can interact with blood-brain barrier cells and get âswallowedâ by them. When the nanoparticle gets in, so does the drug it carries. Another type of nanoparticle doesn't even need to carry medicine. The material itself is a powerful antioxidant that crosses the blood-brain barrier. It's called a cerium oxide nanoparticle, and it helped relieve some MS symptoms in mice."
What are recent findings and ongoing research on the root causes of MS?,"Scientists are looking for ways to: Stop the disease from getting worse Restore lost function Prevent and cure MS Besides testing new treatments, scientists continue to explore the root causes of MS. Much of the research is still being done in animals, but recent findings and ongoing research include: Bone marrow stem cell transplants that would offer long-term benefits An epilepsy pill that slowed nerve damage A specific type of training that improved memory and brain activity (as seen on MRI scans). Changes were still in place after 6 months. An experimental therapy in mice helped their bodies make myelin, a substance that protects nerves. The treatment is a type of micro RNA, a small amount of genetic material. A large team of researchers is analyzing gut bacteria to find out what role it may play as MS gets worse. Researchers are studying children with MS to learn how their environment and genes make them more likely to get the disease. One early finding suggested low vitamin D levels were linked to MS relapses in kids with a specific gene."
How does stem transplant work in treating multiple sclerosis?,"You might hear your doctor call it: Stem cell transplant Bone marrow transplant HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) How does it work? Doctors remove and store cells from your body that make blood. Then, you take chemotherapy drugs to wipe out your immune system. After that, your stem cells go back in your body. They travel to your bone marrow, where they make new blood cells, giving your immune system a fresh start. Studies show that bone marrow stem cell transplants might help some people with MS. However, the treatment is still experimental."
What do I need to know about stem cells transplant in treating multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"These are the only cells in your body with the power to create new types of cells. For example, your blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle, and bone all come from stem cells. People who need new, healthy cells to fight a disease like cancer often get bone marrow stem cell transplants. This procedure can help rebuild your immune system by producing new blood cells. You might hear your doctor call it: Stem cell transplant Bone marrow transplant HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) How does it work?"
What should someone do before getting elbow replacement surgery?,"Your doctor will ask you about your medical history. Tell them about any conditions you have, including allergies. Also let your doctor know if you drink alcohol and what medicines you take. She also needs to know about any vitamins, supplements, or herbal products you use. If you smoke, you should stop before your surgery."
What happens after elbow replacement surgery?,"After the operation, you'll have stitches and a bandage on your new elbow. You may also need to keep your arm in a splint to keep it stable while it heals. Because elbow replacement involves cutting skin, tendons, and bone, you'll need strong pain medications after surgery. You'll also take pain meds for 1 to 2 weeks after you go home from the hospital. It will take time to get used to your new elbow. For instance, you won't be able to lift anything heavier than a cup of coffee for 6 weeks after surgery. It's a good idea to line up help ahead of time."

How can someone find a surgeon who has a lot of experience to perform their elbow replacement surgery?,The procedure is similar to hip and knee replacements. You want a surgeon who has a lot of experience. Ask your rheumatologist or other doctor for referrals. You may also want to check with the professional association of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons.

How long will it take to get used to my new elbow after elbow replacement surgery?,"It will take time to get used to your new elbow. For instance, you won't be able to lift anything heavier than a cup of coffee for 6 weeks after surgery. It's a good idea to line up help ahead of time."
What are common complications from elbow replacement surgery?,"The most common complications are: Infection Injury to nerves and blood vessels Allergic reaction to the artificial joint Broken bone Stiffness or instability of the joint Loosening or wearing of the artificial parts Weakness or failure in the tendons of your arm Pain There are risks because of the anesthesia, such as an allergic reaction to those medicines and breathing problems. As with any surgery, bleeding and blood clots are possible, too."
How long does elbow surgery take?,"Elbow replacement surgery takes about 2 hours. You'll get anesthesia, so you won't be âawakeâ for it. You'll need to stay in the hospital for up to 4 days."

As with any surgery, bleeding and blood clots are possible, too."
What does the recovery and physical therapy entail for elbow replacement surgery?,"You'll do ârange of motionâ exercises, such as bending and straightening your arm. Elbow replacement usually reduces pain and helps your elbow work better. But it may not make the joint as good as it was before disease or injury hurt it. You'll need to avoid activities that can cause further injury, such as hammering, playing contact sports, and lifting heavy weights. With good care, your new elbow should serve you well for many years."

What is the treatment for lipodystrophy?,"But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections ( Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, she'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control her blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse. Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, she may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out her face with skin grafts from her thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for her appearance makes sense and when."
What should you expect if you have lipodystrophy?,"Over time, people with AGL can lose most or all of their body fat. With APL, it typically stops after a few years. In general, the more fat you lose, the more serious the condition is. Yet many people with lipodystrophy live active, productive lives. You'll need to work closely with your doctor to prevent complications. For example, people with AGL are likely to have heart and liver problems. Diabetes can be hard to control. They might develop autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo (light-colored spots of skin), rheumatoid arthritis, and a kind of hepatitis. People with APL probably won't have the insulin-related problems that often come with AGL. But it can lead to kidneys that don't work well or at all, and drusen, tiny fat deposits in the back of the eyes that may be connected to age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Women may get extra fat on their hips and thighs. AGL and APL can be linked to autoimmune disorders, too, including rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Researchers are studying lipodystrophy, and they may find more ways to treat it."
What are acquired lipodystrophies?,"Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy ( AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy ( APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer- Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. APL typically starts around ages 8-10. Both conditions affect girls 3 times more often than boys. Both cause a person to lose fat from her face, so she may look sick or much older than she is. Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble. However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications."
What will your doctor look for to diagnose lipodystrophy?,"Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells."
How can a urine test help to diagnose a lipodystrophy?,"Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells."
How can you take care of your child with lipodystrophy?,"Because this condition affects how you look, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and being supportive. Set the tone for others. Be positive and open-minded. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying, or offending or embarrassing you and your child. When someone asks about her, be matter-of-fact about her condition. Do what you can to boost her self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. Encourage friendships. But kids will be kids, so prepare her for unkind looks and words. You can help her practice how she'll react with role-play and humor. Consider professional counseling. Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease."
What are the symptoms of acquired partial lipodystrophy (AGL)?,"This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with her face and moves to her neck, arms, and chest."
Where can you get support for lipodystrophy?,"If you're looking for a community, Lipodystrophy United is a good place to start. It has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families."
What questions should you ask your doctor about a lipodystrophy?,"What type of lipodystrophy is this? Do you know what caused it? Do we need any more tests? How many other people with this condition have you treated? What's the best way for us to treat it? What other symptoms should we watch for? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research trial?"
What are the symptoms of localized lipodystrophy?,"This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps."
What are types of acquired lipodystrophies?,"Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy ( AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy ( APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer- Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too."
How is a lipodystrophy diagnosis confirmed?,"Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells."
What questions will my doctor ask for lipodystrophy diagnosis?,"When you go to the doctor, he'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child's health: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Are changes in how she looks only in certain areas, or all over? Has she had panniculitis -- swollen bumps under her skin or a bumpy red rash? Does she have diabetes? What other health problems or recent injuries has she had? Have you had her blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked?"
What are the symptoms of acquired partial lipodystrophy?,"This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with her face and moves to her neck, arms, and chest."

Who can get lipodystrophy?,Some people with HIV get lipodystrophy ( LD- HIV). It may be related to the medicines they take or the disease itself.
What causes lipodystrophy?,"Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: An infection, such as measles, pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or hepatitis A disease where your immune system attacks your body (called an autoimmune disease) Repeated injections in or pressure on the same place on your body An injury For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots."
Can children get localized lipodystrophy?,"Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble."
How do you know if you have an allergy?,"Confirm you have allergies. Only a doctor can tell you for sure whether you have an allergy. You may have something else, such as an infection. When you know what you have, you can get the right treatment."
When should you make an appointment to your allergist?,"You may want to make an appointment if: You have symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, cough, or watery eyes that last for more than three months and make it hard for you to work or sleep. You've tried over-the-counter drugs and still need more relief. You get a lot of sinus infections, headaches, stuffy nose, or ear infections. You snore or have trouble staying asleep. You have other health problems such as heart disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, glaucoma, high blood pressure, enlarged prostate, liver disease, or kidney disease. If you do, it may not be safe to treat allergies on your own with over-the-counter drugs."
Will an allergist check that I'm taking the right medicine?,"Check that you have the right medicine. Over-the-counter drugs can often help with allergies. Some people, though, also need prescription medicine to handle the symptoms. Your doctor can advise you about your medicines and make sure you have the prescriptions you need."
What is an allergy treatment plan?,"A treatment plan will help you know what you need to do. It should include what kind of medicine to take and when to take it, what things you need to avoid because of your allergies, and how to be ready for and what to do if you have a serious allergic reaction."
What should be in your allergy treatment plan?,"An allergist will give you tests to help you identify specifically what triggers your allergies Make a treatment plan. A treatment plan will help you know what you need to do. It should include what kind of medicine to take and when to take it, what things you need to avoid because of your allergies, and how to be ready for and what to do if you have a serious allergic reaction."
What is pustular psoriasis?,"Other types of psoriasis include: Pustular psoriasis , which causes red and scaly skin with tiny pustules on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet."

What are symptoms of psoriasis?,"$('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: Plaques of red skin, often covered with silver-colored scales. These plaques may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed. In severe cases, the plaques will grow and merge, covering large areas. Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, including discoloration and pitting of the nails."
What is psoriasis associated with?,It causes pain and swelling in the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that between 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis.
What are examples of sensory integration therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Examples of sensory integration therapy include: Being brushed or deeply touched and massaged Compressing elbows and knees Swinging Spinning on a scooter Wearing a weighted vest You can obtain occupational therapy services either privately, through a statewide early childhood intervention program, or at school."
What are benefits of occupational therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"These OT strategies include: Physical activities, such as stringing beads or doing puzzles, to help a child develop coordination and body awareness Play activities to help with interaction and communication Developmental activities, such as brushing teeth and combing hair Adaptive strategies, including coping with transitions The overall goal of occupational therapy is to help the person with autism improve his or her quality of life at home and in school. The therapist helps introduce, maintain, and improve skills so that people with autism can be as independent as possible."
What are some signs of processing issues in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"That's because some researchers estimate that eight out of 10 children with autism have problems processing sensory input. For example, they can't filter out background noise. Other signs of processing issues include: Problems with balance Problems with body position in space Oversensitivity to touch and the feel of certain types of clothing, such as socks with seams With autism, social, behavioral, or attention problems can be partly a result of these sensory challenges."
What kinds of things does an occupational look at to help evaluate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children?,"The therapist observes children to see if they can do tasks they are expected to do at their ages -- getting dressed or playing a game, for example. Sometimes, the therapist will have the child videotaped during the day in order to see how the child interacts with his or her environment so that he or she can better assess the kind of care the child needs. The therapist might note any of the following: Attention span and stamina Transition to new activities Play skills Need for personal space Responses to touch or other types of stimuli Motor skills such as posture, balance, or manipulation of small objects Aggression or other types of behaviors Interactions between the child and caregivers Once an occupational therapist has gathered information, he or she can develop a program for your child."
What are skills that occupational therapy may foster in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"These are some of the skills occupational therapy may foster: Daily living skills, such as toilet training, dressing, brushing teeth, and other grooming skills Fine motor skills required for holding objects while handwriting or cutting with scissors Gross motor skills used for walking, climbing stairs, or riding a bike Sitting, posture, or perceptual skills, such as telling the differences between colors, shapes, and sizes Awareness of his or her body and its relation to others Visual skills for reading and writing Play, coping, self-help, problem solving, communication, and social skills By working on these skills during occupational therapy, a child with autism may be able to: Develop peer and adult relationships Learn how to focus on tasks Learn how to delay gratification Express feelings in more appropriate ways Engage in play with peers Learn how to self-regulate You may have heard a lot about sensory integration therapy."
Can nasal sprays be used for children?,"A lot of over-the-counter decongestants, including these sprays, aren't recommended for children. Read the labels carefully and talk to your pediatrician."
What are decongestant nasal sprays?,"You can buy these over the counter or with a prescription from your doctor. They get rid of your stuffiness by narrowing blood vessels in the lining of your nose, which shrinks swollen tissues. Don't use them for more than 3 days, or your cold symptoms could get worse."
What are steroid nasal sprays?,"You can get these over the counter or with a prescription. They're approved to relieve allergy symptoms, but they're sometimes used to help clear a stuffed-up nose that comes from a sinus infection."
Are different nasal sprays used differently?,"Some sprays may have different instructions on the label, so use those or follow your doctor's directions. Don't use it for longer than recommended by your doctor or the maker of the nasal spray."
What are the side effects of nasal sprays?,"Decongestant products, including nasal sprays, can raise blood pressure and pulse rate. They can also cause you to feel nervous or dizzy, or make it hard for you to get to sleep. Some decongestants may interfere with other medications you take. Check with your doctor before you use them."
"What are salt-water solutions, or saline nasal sprays?","Salt-water solutions. They're also called ""saline"" nasal sprays, and you can buy them without a prescription. They loosen up your mucus and keep it from getting crusty. Since they don't contain any medications, feel free to use them as often you like."
What medical conditions should stop someone from using nasal spray?,"You might want to avoid some nasal sprays if you have high blood pressure, a heart condition, diabetes, thyroid problems, or urinary problems from an enlarged prostate."
How can exercise help impulsivity in children with ADHD?,"If you've ever sent your child outside to burn off some energy when he or she was misbehaving, you were on the right track. Studies find that exercise helps control impulses and other behavior problems in kids with ADHD. Think about signing your child up for a sports team, such as basketball, soccer, or baseball. Playing a sport not only gives kids exercise, but it also teaches them important social skills, such as how to follow rules and take turns."
Who gets sleep apnea?,"Sleep apnea can affect anyone at any age, even children. Risk factors for sleep apnea include: Being male Being overweight Being over age 40 Having a large neck size (17 inches or greater in men and 16 inches or greater in women) Having large tonsils, a large tongue, or a small jaw bone Having a family history of sleep apnea Nasal obstruction due to a deviated septum, allergies, or sinus problems If left untreated, sleep apnea can increase the risk of health problems, including: High blood pressure Stroke Heart failure, irregular heart beats, and heart attacks Diabetes Depression Worsening of ADHD Headaches In addition, untreated sleep apnea may be responsible for poor performance in everyday activities, such as at work and school, motor vehicle crashes, and academic underachievement in children and adolescents."
How does sleep apnea affect your body?,"Risk factors for sleep apnea include: Being male Being overweight Being over age 40 Having a large neck size (17 inches or greater in men and 16 inches or greater in women) Having large tonsils, a large tongue, or a small jaw bone Having a family history of sleep apnea Nasal obstruction due to a deviated septum, allergies, or sinus problems If left untreated, sleep apnea can increase the risk of health problems, including: High blood pressure Stroke Heart failure, irregular heart beats, and heart attacks Diabetes Depression Worsening of ADHD Headaches In addition, untreated sleep apnea may be responsible for poor performance in everyday activities, such as at work and school, motor vehicle crashes, and academic underachievement in children and adolescents."
What is sleep apnea?,"Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times. This means the brain -- and the rest of the body -- may not get enough oxygen."
What does heat rash look like?,"It looks like tiny bumps surrounded by red skin. It usually happens on clothed parts of the body, such as your back, abdomen, neck, upper chest, groin, or armpits. And it usually gets better once your skin cools off."
What is heat rash?,"Heat rash, also called prickly heat or miliaria, is a common condition in which areas of the skin feel prickly or sting due to overheating. It can itch a lot, but it's not dangerous."
What is severe persistent asthma?,"Symptoms occur continuously, with frequent nighttime asthma. Activities are limited. Lung function is decreased to less than 60% of predicted values."
Who's likely to have adult-onset asthma?,"Among those who may be more likely to get adult-onset asthma are: Women who are having hormonal changes, such as those who are pregnant or who are experiencing menopause Women who take estrogen following menopause for 10 years or longer People who have just had certain viruses or illnesses, such as a cold or flu People with allergies, especially to cats People who have GERD, a type of chronic heartburn with reflux People who are exposed to environmental irritants, such as tobacco smoke, mold, dust, feather beds, or perfume Irritants that bring on asthma symptoms are called ""asthma triggers."""
What are bronchodilators for treating asthma?,"Bronchodilators: These medications relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways. This action rapidly opens the airways, letting more air in and out of the lungs and improving breathing. As the airways open, the mucus moves more freely and can be coughed out more easily."
What is adult-onset asthma?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } When asthma symptoms appear and are diagnosed in adults older than age 20, it is typically known as adult-onset asthma. About half of adults who have asthma also have allergies. Adult-onset asthma also may be the result of commonplace irritants in the workplace (called occupational asthma) or home environments, and the asthma symptoms come on suddenly."
What are the categories of asthma?,These categories are: mild intermittent; mild persistent; moderate persistent; and severe persistent. Your physician will determine the severity and control of your asthma based on how frequently you have symptoms and on lung function tests.
How do you keep track of well your lungs are working?,"The meter can alert you to changes in the airways that may be a sign of worsening asthma. By taking daily peak flow readings, you can learn when to adjust medications to keep asthma under good control. Your doctor can also use this information to adjust your treatment plan."
What are treatment goals of asthma?,"Treatment goals include the following: Live an active, normal life Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms Attend work or school every day Perform daily activities without difficulty Stop urgent visits to the doctor, emergency room, or hospital Use and adjust medications to control asthma with little or no side effects Properly using asthma medication, as prescribed by your doctor, is the basis of good asthma control, in addition to avoiding triggers and monitoring daily asthma symptoms."
Can a chest x-ray diagnose adult-onset asthma?,"Your doctor might perform an X-ray exam on you in order to see the structures inside your chest, including the heart, lungs, and bones. By viewing your lungs, your doctor can see if you have a condition other than asthma that may account for your symptoms."
How is adult-onset asthma diagnosed?,"Your asthma doctor may diagnose adult-onset asthma by: Taking a medical history, asking about symptoms, and listening to you breathe Performing a lung function test, using a device called a spirometer, to measure how much air you can exhale after first taking a deep breath and how fast you can empty your lungs."
What is an asthma action plan?,"The asthma action plan describes when and how to use asthma medications, actions to take when asthma worsens, and when to seek care for an asthma emergency."
What are the symptoms of asthma?,"In the airways there is: Swelling or inflammation, specifically in the airway linings Production of large amounts of mucus that is thicker than normal Narrowing because of muscle contractions surrounding the airways The symptoms of asthma include: Feeling short of breath Frequent coughing, especially at night Wheezing (a whistling noise during breathing) Difficulty breathing Chest tightness When a doctor makes a diagnosis of asthma in people older than age 20, it is known as adult-onset asthma."
How can a methacholine challenge test diagnose adult-onset asthma?,"Performing a methacholine challenge test; this asthma test may be performed if your symptoms and spirometry test do not clearly show asthma. When inhaled, methacholine causes the airways to spasm and narrow if asthma is present."
Who's more likely to have asthma?,"Anyone can get asthma at any age. Among those at higher risk for asthma are people who: Have a family history of asthma Have a history of allergies (allergic asthma) Have smokers living in the household Live in urban areas Asthma is classified into four categories based upon frequency of symptoms and objective measures, such as peak flow measurements and/or spirometry results."
How common is Tourette's syndrome compared to ADHD?,"Also, Tourette's syndrome is rare. The CDC found that about 138,000 kids in the U. S. have been diagnosed with it, while about 6.4 million have ever been diagnosed with ADHD."
How does Tourette's syndrome differ from ADHD?,"Tics from Tourette's syndrome are different from the movements or noises that kids with ADHD might make. They almost always involve fast, repeated face or shoulder movements or sounds, which happen the same way each time. Often, kids with ADHD won't have any tic-like movements. Instead, they have trouble staying focused or paying attention. They might be easily distracted or have problems staying organized. Children with Tourette's syndrome often outgrow their tics by their late teens or early adult years -- they happen less often and sometimes disappear altogether. ADHD symptoms often last into adulthood."
How are ADHD and Tourette's syndrome alike?,"Signs of both conditions tend to show up around the same age. Symptoms of ADHD can start to appear between ages 3 and 6. Most kids are diagnosed during elementary school. On average, Tourette's syndrome begins around 7 years old. And some children have both conditions. More than 60% of those with Tourette's syndrome also have ADHD. They also may have related conditions, like obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD), learning disorders, and depression. Researchers have found that there may be a genetic link between Tourette's syndrome and disorders like ADHD and OCD. They have a similar biology that makes them more likely to happen together."
What does the treatment for ADHD involve?,"Treatment for kids with ADHD often includes a mix of medication and behavior therapy. Stimulants are the drugs that are most commonly prescribed for the condition, but other drugs, like atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine, and antidepressants, can help, too. In behavior therapy for ADHD, kids learn or build on positive behaviors to replace others that cause problems."
How is Tourette syndrome or ADHD diagnosed?,"Your doctor will be able to tell whether your child's symptoms belong to ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, both, or something else. There's no special test to diagnose either condition. Your doctor will ask about symptoms and when they started. He might do a blood test and medical exam to see if anything else could be causing the problem."
Can you prevent genital herpes?,"The only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. Short of that, a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. Remember, you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. Likewise, you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. If you know that a sex partner has genital herpes, you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. Nevertheless, genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms, so you should always use a latex barrier, such as a condom or a dental dam."
Is there a cure for genital herpes?,Genital herpes is a lifelong condition for which there is no cure.
How is otosclerosis diagnosed?,"If you notice you have trouble hearing, see an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT). He'll look closely at your ear, test your hearing, and ask about your family health history. In some cases, he may recommend a computerized tomography ( CT) scan. A series of X-rays are taken at different angles and put together to make a more detailed image."
At what age does otosclerosis start?,"You can develop otosclerosis between the ages of 10 and 45, but you're most likely to get it during your 20s. Symptoms usually are at their worst in your 30s."
What are the symptoms of otosclerosis?,"The main symptom of otosclerosis is hearing loss. At first, you may notice that you can't hear low-pitched sounds or people whispering. This usually gets worse over time. Most people with otosclerosis have hearing loss in both ears. About 10% to 15% have hearing loss in just one ear. Other symptoms include: Dizziness or balance problems Tinnitus, or ringing, roaring, or hissing in your ears Sometimes tinnitus can be a problem after you have ear surgery to treat otosclerosis."
What is otosclerosis?,"Otosclerosis is a rare condition that causes hearing loss. It happens when a small bone in your middle ear -- usually the one called the stapes -- gets stuck in place. Most of the time, this happens when bone tissue in your middle ear grows around the stapes in a way it shouldn't. Your stapes bone has to vibrate for you to hear well. When it can't do that, sound can't travel from your middle ear to your inner ear. That makes it hard for you to hear."
How many people are affected by otosclerosis in the U.S.?,"Experts aren't sure why, but if you're a woman and develop otosclerosis during pregnancy, you're likely to lose your hearing faster than if you were a man or you weren't pregnant."
Does otosclerosis run in families?,"It often runs in families. About half of all people with otosclerosis have a gene that's linked to the condition. But even if you have the gene, you won't necessarily get it."
Can other medical problems increase your risk for otosclerosis?,"Certain medical problems can raise your chances of otosclerosis. For example, if you had measles at any time, your risk may go up. Stress fractures to the bony tissue around your inner ear also might make it more likely to happen. And immune disorders, in which your immune system mistakenly attacks parts of your body, also can be linked to the condition."
Is otosclerosis more common in men or women?,"Both men and women get otosclerosis. Women, though, have a higher risk. Experts aren't sure why, but if you're a woman and develop otosclerosis during pregnancy, you're likely to lose your hearing faster than if you were a man or you weren't pregnant."
What race has the highest risk for otosclerosis?,Caucasians are most likely to get it. About 10% develop otosclerosis. It's less common in other groups and rare for African- Americans.
What conditions not tied to your liver can raise your aspartate aminotransferase level?,These other conditions not tied to your liver can also raise your AST level: Burns Heart attack Intense exercise Muscle injury Pregnancy Pancreatitis Seizures Surgery Some diseases or medicines you take can cause a âfalse positiveâ result on the AST test.
Why would you need an aspartate aminotransferase test?,"Your doctor can order an AST test if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as: Yellow skin or eyes, called jaundice Tiredness Weakness Swollen belly Stomach pain Appetite loss Itchy skin Dark-colored urine Light-colored poop Swelling in your legs and ankles Bruises Other reasons to have this test: You've been exposed to the hepatitis virus."
What can cause a false positive aspartate aminotransferase test result?,"These other conditions not tied to your liver can also raise your AST level: Burns Heart attack Intense exercise Muscle injury Pregnancy Pancreatitis Seizures Surgery Some diseases or medicines you take can cause a âfalse positiveâ result on the AST test. This means your test is positive, even though you don't have liver damage. Any of these can cause a false positive result: Diabetic ketoacidosis ( Your body can't make enough insulin, which helps sugar enter your cells.)"
What happens during an aspartate aminotransferase test?,"A nurse or lab tech will take a sample of your blood -- usually from a vein in your arm. She will first tie a band around the upper part of your arm to make your vein fill with blood and swell up. Then she will clean an area on your arm with an antiseptic and put a needle in one of your veins. Your blood will go into a vial or tube. The blood test should only take a couple of minutes. After your blood is drawn, the lab tech will take off the band and pull out the needle. She'll put a piece of gauze and a bandage where the needle went in to stop the bleeding."
Why do you need other tests in addition to an aspartate aminotransferase test?,"Some antibiotics, such as erythromycin estolate or para-aminosalicylic acid ( Paser) AST is usually done as part of a group of liver function tests called a liver panel. It's often ordered with a test for alanine aminotransferase ( ALT), another liver enzyme. ALT is more accurate than AST at detecting liver disease. It can more accurately show whether the problem is in your liver or in another part of your body, like your heart or muscles. Your doctor can compare the amount of ALT to AST in your blood to find out whether you have liver damage or a problem with another organ, such as your heart."
What are other reasons for an aspartate aminotransferase test?,"Your doctor can order an AST test if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as: Yellow skin or eyes, called jaundice Tiredness Weakness Swollen belly Stomach pain Appetite loss Itchy skin Dark-colored urine Light-colored poop Swelling in your legs and ankles Bruises Other reasons to have this test: You've been exposed to the hepatitis virus. You drink a lot of alcohol. You take medicine that's known to damage the liver. You have a family history of liver disease. You have obesity. You have diabetes or metabolic syndrome. You've had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Your doctor might also want you to get this test to see if treatments you take for liver disease are working. The AST test is also part of a comprehensive metabolic panel -- a blood test your doctor does as part of a routine exam."
When should you talk to your doctor about an aspartate aminotransferase test?,"Your doctor might also do other tests of enzymes and proteins your liver makes, such as: Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) Bilirubin Total protein Talk with your doctor to make sure you understand all of your liver test results. Also find out how these results might affect your treatment."
How do you prepare for an aspartate aminotransferase test?,You don't need any special preparation for the ALT test. Tell your doctor what drugs or supplements you take. Some medicines can affect the results of this test.
What is Rett syndrome?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Rett syndrome is a rare, severe neurological disorder that affects mostly girls. It's usually discovered in the first two years of life, and a child's diagnosis with Rett syndrome can feel overwhelming. Although there's no cure, early identification and treatment may help girls and families who are affected by Rett syndrome. In the past, it was felt to be part of the Autism Spectrum Disorder. We now know that it is mostly genetically based."
How effective are treatments for Rett syndrome?,"The best options available to treat Rett syndrome include: Standard medical care and medication Physical therapy Speech therapy Occupational therapy Good nutrition Behavioral therapy Supportive services Experts believe that therapy can help girls with Rett syndrome and their parents. Some girls may be able to go to school and learn better social interaction. Medicines can treat some of the problems with movement in Rett syndrome. Medication can also help control seizures. Many girls with Rett syndrome can live at least into middle age. Researchers are studying women with the disease, which was only widely recognized in the last 20 years."
What causes Rett syndrome?,"Most children with Rett syndrome have a mutation on the X chromosome. Exactly what this gene does, or how its mutation leads to Rett syndrome, isn't clear. Researchers believe that the single gene may influence many other genes involved in development. Although Rett syndrome is genetic, children almost never inherit the faulty gene from their parents. Rather, it's a chance mutation that happens in DNA. When boys develop the Rett syndrome mutation, they rarely live past birth. Males have only one X chromosome (instead of the two girls have), so the effects of the disease are much more serious, and almost always fatal."
How does Rett syndrome develop?,"The age when symptoms appear varies, but most babies with Rett syndrome seem to grow normally for the first 6 months before any signs of the disorder are obvious. The most common changes usually show up when babies are between 12 and 18 months, and they can be sudden or progress slowly."
What is diaper dermatitis?,"Red, irritated, or scaly skin on your baby's bottom is likely due to diaper dermatitis -- better known as diaper rash. This common condition is usually seen in infants ages 9 to 12 months. It shows up around the folds of the thighs and genitals -- places covered by a diaper Diaper rash can result from an allergy or irritated skin."
Who is most likely to get lichen planus?,"Middle-aged adults are most likely to get it. Doctors aren't sure what causes lichen planus. It may be an autoimmune disorder. It's often seen in people who have hepatitis C. If you get it, ask your doctor about screening for hepatitis."
What is the main symptom of actinic keratosis?,"The main symptom is a thick, scaly, discolored patch of skin. Sometimes the area feels rough or like sandpaper but looks normal. It may be painful to touch. It can flake off, and your skin may feel normal again. However, the problem spot typically comes back when you're exposed to sunlight."
What can trigger eczema?,"But adults who never had it can get it, too. Doctors don't know what causes it. They think it's a mix of genetics and things in your environment that your skin reacts to, like: Wool Soap Perfume Makeup Chlorine Cigarette smoke You might notice these symptoms: Red, irritated, or swollen skin Crusting or oozing Scaly patches that feel rough or leathery Severe itching Silvery white scales that cover thick red, raised patches of skin are a telltale sign of plaque psoriasis."
What is actinic keratosis?,"A flaky, scaly patch that comes and goes could be actinic keratosis ( AK), a precancerous condition. You could get this scaly skin problem if you spend too much time in a tanning bed or unprotected in the sun. Without treatment, it can turn into squamous cell skin cancer. If you get one actinic keratosis, you usually will get another."
How can diaper rash occur?,"It shows up around the folds of the thighs and genitals -- places covered by a diaper Diaper rash can result from an allergy or irritated skin. It could also be a yeast infection -- yeast thrives in warm, moist environments. Signs include a reddish irritated skin rash. At-home care may be fine for irritation rashes, but if your baby's diaper rash won't go away, see a doctor to figure out the cause and best treatment."
What is pityriasis rosea?,"Women or girls ages 10 to 35 are more likely to get this skin condition. The main sign is a single round, rose- or tan-colored spot (called a herald patch) in the middle of your body, arms, or legs. A cluster of scaly patches follows about a week or two later. The round spots have raised borders. There may be little or no scaly skin symptoms in children or pregnant women."
How many types of psoriasis are there?,"The new and old cells clump together, causing thick, itchy patches, sores, and scales There are several different types of psoriasis. Scaly skin is most common with plaque psoriasis. It can show up on your knees, scalp, elbows, palms, lower back and the soles of your feet. The condition may also cause your nails to pit, crumble, or fall off. Psoriasis can be passed down through families. Infections, stress, obesity, and smoking can increase your risk for psoriasis. It isn't contagious."
How can I treat my child's dyslexia?,Testing and screening for dyslexia are available and are very important.
What is the assessment for dyslexia?,"An assessment for dyslexia includes reading or writing while the tester looks for signs of dyslexia, such as adding, dropping, or changing words; pulling words from other lines; or reversing or transposing words and letters. While not diagnostic in itself, body language may provide a clue: A person with dyslexia may frequently clear his or her throat, tap a pencil, or fidget during the testing out of anxiety about performing the test."
How can a person get dyslexia?,"Dyslexia is a disorder present at birth and cannot be prevented or cured, but it can be managed with special instruction and support. Early intervention to address reading problems is important. Parents must understand that children with dyslexia can learn normally, but probably need to learn in different ways than children without the condition. Teaching should be individualized and may involve modeling letters and words in clay or other three-dimensional techniques to help the child learn letters and words."
Is bee pollen safe for pregnant women?,"A woman should also avoid using bee pollen if she is breastfeeding. Bee pollen may cause increased bleeding if taken with certain blood thinners like warfarin. Check with your doctor before taking bee pollen if you take any medications, over-the-counter medicines, or herbals."
Can bee pollen trigger allergic reactions?,"Bee pollen appears to be safe for most people, at least when taken for a short term. But if you have pollen allergies, you may get more than you bargained for. Bee pollen can cause a serious allergic reaction -- including shortness of breath, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis."
What activities do I have to avoid while I have mononucleosis?,"Since your spleen, which is an organ in your abdomen, often becomes enlarged when you have mono, it's more likely to rupture. So you will need to avoid contact sports such as football and soccer, probably for about 3-4 weeks. Your doctor can let you know when it's OK to get back to those activities."
What medication can help with mononucleosis?,"In case mono has affected your liver, check with your doctor before you take acetaminophen. Don't give aspirin to children or teens. It's been linked to a disease called Reye's syndrome, a serious illness that can be life-threatening. Call 911 if you or your child is having any trouble breathing. If your sore throat is so severe that you have trouble breathing or eating, your doctor may give you prednisone, a steroid."
How is mononucleosis diagnosed?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Mononucleosis, or ""mono,"" has a wide range of symptoms, which can make it hard to diagnose. You'll need to see your doctor to find out if you have it. Your doctor will give you a complete physical exam. You may get a throat culture to rule out strep throat, which has symptoms that are similar to mono. Your doctor may also take a sample of blood to check for abnormal white blood cells."
When will I get better from mononucleosis?,"Most people start to recover from mononucleosis within 2 weeks, though some symptoms, such as fatigue, can take 3-4 weeks or even longer to go away. So a common treatment plan for mono is rest with a gradual return to normal activity. The goal is to ease your symptoms and treat any complications that happen."
What is a heterophile antibody test in relation to mononucleosis?,"You may also get a heterophile antibody test. It checks your blood for special antibodies that your body makes to fight off a viral infection. But it's not specific to mono. This test isn't always accurate, especially in younger children, and it takes several days for it to show the presence of the antibodies after a child starts to feel ill. The âmonospotâ is one test that checks for heterophile antibodies."

What are the side effects of using opioids for pain relief?,Side effects of opioids may include: Drowsiness Nausea Constipation Itching Breathing problems Addiction Antidepressants are drugs that can treat pain and/or emotional conditions by adjusting levels of neurotransmitters (natural chemicals) in the brain.
What are some other pain relievers?,"The most common side effects include: Drowsiness Dizziness Fatigue Nausea Another means of topical pain relief comes in the form of a lidocaine ( Lidoderm) patch, which is a prescription medication. If your pain is not relieved by the usual treatments, your doctor may refer you to a pain management specialist. Doctors who specialize in pain management may try other treatments such as certain types of physical therapy or other kinds of medicine. They may also recommend TENS, a procedure that uses patches placed on the skin to send signals that may help stop pain. Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) is a method of pain control that allows the patient to control the amount of pain medication administered. This is often used in the hospital to treat pain. By pushing a button on a computerized pump, the patient receives a pre-measured dose of pain medicine. The pump is connected to a small tube that allows medicine to be injected intravenously (into a vein), subcutaneously (just under the skin), or into the spinal area."
What are opioids?,"Some examples of opioids include: Morphine Fentanyl Oxycodone Codeine Opioids are effective for severe pain and do not cause bleeding in the stomach or other parts of the body, as can some other types of pain relievers.

Acetaminophen and NSAIDs also work differently. NSAIDs relieve pain by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause pain. Acetaminophen works on the parts of the brain that receive the ""pain messages."" NSAIDs are also available in a prescription strength that can be prescribed by your physician. Using NSAIDs increase the risk of heart attack or stroke and have also been known to cause stomach ulcers and bleeding. They can also cause kidney problems."
What are some prescription pain relievers?,"Some examples of topical pain relievers include Aspercreme, Ben- Gay, Icy Hot, and Capzasin- P.

Which antidepressants work best to treat pain?,"Chronic pain conditions treated by low-dose antidepressants include some types of headaches (like migraines) and menstrual pain. Some antidepressant medications include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) such as citalopram ( Celexa), fluoxetine ( Prozac), paroxetine ( Paxil), and sertraline ( Zoloft) Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, desipramine ( Norpramin), doxepin ( Silenor), imipramine ( Tofranil), and nortriptyline ( Pamelor) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) such as venlafaxine ( Effexor) and duloxetine ( Cymbalta) These drugs require a steady dose of the medicine buildup in the body over a period of time to work. The doses needed to treat pain are often lower than those needed to treat depression."
What are anticonvulsants?,"The most common side effects with antidepressants include: Blurry vision Constipation Difficulty urinating Dry mouth Fatigue Nausea Headache Anticonvulsants are drugs typically used to treat seizure disorders. Some of these medications are shown to be effective in treating pain as well. The exact way in which these medicines control pain is unclear but it is thought that they minimize the effects of nerves that cause pain. Some examples include carbamazepine ( Tegretol), gabapentin ( Neurontin), and pregabalin ( Lyrica)."
How do antidepressants treat pain relief?,"Side effects of opioids may include: Drowsiness Nausea Constipation Itching Breathing problems Addiction Antidepressants are drugs that can treat pain and/or emotional conditions by adjusting levels of neurotransmitters (natural chemicals) in the brain.

When should I get surgery for a deviated septum?,"If possible, it is best to wait until after the nose has stopped growing, around age 15, to have surgery."
When should I see a doctor about a deviated septum?,"Although rare, risks of septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty may include: Infection Bleeding Hole (perforation) of the septum Loss of the ability to smell If you are having nasal symptoms and think you may have a deviated septum, make an appointment to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT. There are a number of reasons why you may be experiencing these symptoms, including chronic sinusitis or nasal allergies. Make sure you get the right diagnosis so that you can get the treatment you need."
What is a deviated septum?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A deviated septum is a condition in which the nasal septum -- the bone and cartilage that divide the nasal cavity of the nose in half -- is significantly off center, or crooked, making breathing difficult. Most people have some sort of imbalance in the size of their breathing passages. In fact, estimates indicate that 80% of people, most unknowingly, have some sort of misalignment to their nasal septum. Only the more severe imbalances cause significant breathing problems and require treatment."
What causes a deviated septum?,Some people are born with a deviated septum. Other people develop a deviated septum after injury or trauma to the nose.
How is a deviated septum treated?,"Sometimes symptoms of a deviated septum can be relieved with medications. If medicine alone doesn't offer adequate relief, a surgical procedure called septoplasty may be needed to repair a crooked septum and improve breathing."
How does surgery treat a deviated septum?,"Sometimes, a rhinoplasty, or ""nose job,"" is combined with septoplasty to improve the appearance of the nose. This procedure is called septorhinoplasty. Septoplasty may also be combined with sinus surgery. Surgery to repair a deviated septum is usually performed in an outpatient setting under local or general anesthesia and takes about one to one and a half hours, depending on the amount of work being done. You should be able to go home three to four hours after surgery. Internal splints or soft packing material may be put in the nose to stabilize the septum as it heals. If a septoplasty is the only procedure performed, there should be little to no swelling or bruising after surgery. However, if a septorhinoplasty is performed, a week or two of swelling and bruising is normal following the procedure."
What are the symptoms of a deviated septum?,"The most common symptom of a deviated septum is nasal congestion, with one side of the nose being more congested than the other, along with difficulty breathing. Recurrent or repeated sinus infections can also be a sign of a deviated septum. Other symptoms include frequent: Nosebleeds Facial pain Headache Postnasal drip Loud breathing and snoring during sleep A deviated septum may also cause sleep apnea, a serious condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep."
What newer procedures treat a deviated septum?,"These are being done for milder cases. No surgery is completely risk-free, and the benefits of undergoing surgery -- in this case, being able to breathe better -- must outweigh the risks. Septoplasty and septorhinoplasty are common and safe procedures; side effects are rare."
What are the risks of surgery for a deviated septum?,"No surgery is completely risk-free, and the benefits of undergoing surgery -- in this case, being able to breathe better -- must outweigh the risks. Septoplasty and septorhinoplasty are common and safe procedures; side effects are rare. Still, talk with your doctor about the possible risks of surgery before you make a treatment decision. Although rare, risks of septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty may include: Infection Bleeding Hole (perforation) of the septum Loss of the ability to smell If you are having nasal symptoms and think you may have a deviated septum, make an appointment to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT."
What characterizes a brainstem stroke?,"Along with vertigo, you'll also have numbness, weakness, trouble speaking, and other stroke symptoms. If you have any of these symptoms, or if you have new vertigo that has not been diagnosed, get immediate emergency help."
Do vestibular migraines cause symptoms of vertigo?,"If you're having a vestibular migraine, you may feel: Dizziness that lasts more than a few minutes Nausea and vomiting Balance problems Extreme motion sensitivity -- feeling sick or dizzy when you move your head, eyes, or body Feeling disoriented or confused Feeling unsteady, like you're in a rocking boat Sensitivity to sound You could get dizzy and have balance problems without having a migraine at all. Other times, the vertigo symptoms happen before, during, or after the headache. Sometimes, you might have migraines for years before the vertigo symptoms begin."
What drugs are used to treat vestibular migraines?,"CGRP inhibitors are a new class of preventive medicine that your doctor may recommend if other medicines don't help. If you have frequent or disabling vestibular migraines, your doctor may try drugs similar to traditional migraine meds."
What are other names for a vestibular migraine?,There are many names for this type of problem. Your doctor might also call it: Migraine-associated vertigo Migrainous vertigo Migraine-related vestibulopathy Vestibular migraines don't always cause headaches.
Is there a specific medication for vestibular migraines?,There's no specific medication for vestibular migraines. Your doctor will prescribe different drugs to stop an attack when it happens. This is called abortive therapy.
Who gets vestibular migraines?,"It's hard to tell how many people are living with this condition. The symptoms mimic a lot of other diseases. Researchers think they affect about 1% of the population. But that number could be higher. Like traditional migraines, they're more common in women than men. Vertigo symptoms tend to first strike around age 40. But the condition doesn't just affect adults. Kids can get it, too."
What causes vestibular migraines?,"Doctors aren't sure. Like migraines, there are a lot of theories. But how it really happens is poorly understood. They credit it to misfires between nerve cells in your brain."
Are vestibular suppressants used to treat vestibular migraines?,"It can ease your dizziness and motion sensitivity. This type of drug works on the balance center in your inner ear. Your doctor might prescribe benzodiazepines like lorazepam ( Ativan), anti-nausea drugs like promethazine ( Phenergan), and antihistamines like meclizine."
How are vestibular migraines diagnosed?,But the International Headache Society and other organizations recently set up the first criteria to help your doctor diagnose the disorder.
What are the symptoms of a vestibular migraine?,"Your doctor might also call it: Migraine-associated vertigo Migrainous vertigo Migraine-related vestibulopathy Vestibular migraines don't always cause headaches. The main symptom is dizziness that comes and goes. Vestibular refers to the inner ear, which controls your hearing and balance. If you're having a vestibular migraine, you may feel: Dizziness that lasts more than a few minutes Nausea and vomiting Balance problems Extreme motion sensitivity -- feeling sick or dizzy when you move your head, eyes, or body Feeling disoriented or confused Feeling unsteady, like you're in a rocking boat Sensitivity to sound You could get dizzy and have balance problems without having a migraine at all."
How does my doctor rule out something else with my vestibular migraine?,"At least half of the episodes happen with one of the following migraine symptoms: A headache that has two of these characteristics: is one-sided, pulsing, moderate to severe, or gets worse with activity Sensitivity to light or sound Seeing shimmering or flashing lights in your vision (a migraine aura) He'll likely order an MRI to check your brain and run hearing and balance tests to look for problems with your ears."
How do temporary anchorage devices (TADs) help in fixing teeth issues?,Other appliances used in orthodontics include: TADs: Temporary anchorage devices ( TADs) are mini-screws ranging from 6 to 12 millimeters in length and 1.2 to 2 millimeters in diameter. When needed they may be temporarily fixed to bone in the mouth to provide a fixed point from which to apply force to move teeth. TADs allow for more predictable tooth control. They are becoming more common in orthodontic treatment.
When should my child see an orthodontist?,"Your dentist can tell you when to seek evaluation from an orthodontist. The American Association of Orthodontists and the American Dental Association recommend all kids be evaluated for orthodontics by age 7. By this age, the orthodontist can detect subtle problems with jaw growth and emerging teeth. Most kids begin active treatment between ages 9 and 14. Orthodontists recommend you correct dental problems while your child is still growing. Once they stop growing, treatment may take longer and require more extensive work."
What is the youngest age a child can get braces?,"There is no set age when children require orthodontics. The treatment plan will depend on individual needs. For example, kids with cleft palates get orthodontic appliances before their first teeth erupt. Other kids may benefit from starting treatment as early as age 6 or 7, even if they have not lost all of their baby teeth. The goal of early treatment is to prevent further problems from developing. It will create a better environment for the permanent teeth to erupt, or grow, into. Most kids who require early orthodontics will still need braces or additional work later to complete the tooth and jaw alignment process."
How long does my child need to wear a retainer?,"Ideally, your child should wear a retainer forever, even if it is only one night a week. Of course, this may not be practical. The teeth are like the rest of the body and the body changes. Once your child stops wearing the retainer, slight changes to the teeth should be expected."
How do rubber bands help in fixing dental issues?,"They are used when more force is needed to move the teeth and jaws into the desired position. You can choose your favorite color. Many kids choose their school colors or decorate their mouth during holidays (for example, orange and black for Halloween)."
Can dentists offer braces at a lower cost?,Dentists: Some general dentists provide orthodontic treatment and may be able to take care of your orthodontic needs at a reduced rate since they are not orthodontists.
What can make you retain water?,"They include: High blood pressure medication Pain relievers known as NSAIDs, including ibuprofen Antidepressants Chemotherapy medication Ask your doctor if your meds may be the problem."
What are some questions I should ask my doctor about my skin allergy?,"Do I need allergy testing? Should I see a specialist? What will make my rash feel better? Will it go away? Can I use over-the-counter medications, or do I need prescription drugs? If I need medicine, what are the possible side effects? Are there things I should avoid? Can I take something to prevent an allergic reaction? Are there other treatments that could help? Should I be worried about an allergic emergency? What should I watch for? Do I need to be concerned about other allergies?"
What kind of doctor should I see if I can't see a rheumatologist for my rheumatoid arthritis?,"If you can't see a rheumatologist for all your RA care, look for one who will partner with your regular doctor. You'll still need to see the rheumatologist once in a while, but your primary care doctor may handle your day-to-day treatment. If it's not possible to see a rheumatologist at all, look for a primary care doctor who treats many people with RA and ask if they can work with a rheumatologist remotely."
What questions should I ask my doctor about rheumatoid arthritis?,"Key things to know about your doctor include: Are they part of a group, or do they work on their own? Can I see the doctor of my choice in the practice, or must I see the first available doctor? How long is the average wait for an appointment? Does the office offer evening or weekend appointments?"
Is it best to see a rheumatologist if I have arthritis?,"If your doctor doesn't have all the traits you'd like, tell them how you feel and ask for what you need. If you're still unhappy, look for another doctor."
Why do I need to be comfortable talking to my doctor about rheumatoid arthritis?,"It's simple: You need to be able to tell your doctor what's going on, and she should be able to communicate clearly to support you. Your doctor should also help you better understand your RA, what to expect from treatment, and what complementary treatments might help or hurt your condition."
What is heart failure and how is it related to breathing issues?,"Even though âfailureâ is in the name, it doesn't mean that your heart stops beating. It means that it's weak. Shortness of breath and feeling tired can be signs of the condition. Often people also have swelling in their ankles, feet, legs, and mid-section because the heart is not strong enough to pump blood properly. In the early stages of heart failure, you may have trouble breathing after exercise, getting dressed, or walking across a room. But as the heart gets weaker, you may feel breathless even when you lie down. See your doctor if that's happening to you. She can recommend medicines and treatments that can help."
What is tachycardia?,"Tachycardia is a fast heart rate -- usually more than 100 beats per minute in an adult. There are several kinds, but one that may cause shortness of breath is SVT, or atrial tachycardia. In SVT, the heart rate speeds up because the heart's electrical signals don't fire properly. People who have SVT and are short of breath should get medical help right away. Your doctor may recommend other things that can help, too, like quitting smoking and drinking less coffee and alcohol."
Are breathing problems ever related to the heart?,"Breathing problems can happen for many reasons, like being out of shape, congestion, fever, or asthma. But in some cases, they're a sign that something is wrong with your heart. Whatever the reason, always take breathing issues seriously. Tell your doctor so he can help you figure out the cause."
Does breastfeeding reduce risk of ear infections?,"Because formula-fed babies are more likely to get ear infections, it is better to breast feed your infant for the first six to 12 months of life, if possible, to prevent ear infections."
How can I prevent ear infections because of a cold in my child?,"Remove as many environmental pollutants from your home as you can, including: Dust Cleaning fluid and solvents Tobacco smoke Also, reduce yours or your child's exposure to people with colds, and control allergies. Taking steps to prevent colds and flu as well as other illnesses can prevent some, but not all, ear infections. Here are some important steps to take: Be sure everyone in your household, including your children receive the proper vaccines when they are supposed to be given. That includes both flu and pneumococcal vaccines. Make hand washing a habit that becomes part of the family's normal routine. If possible, avoid group care for children, especially during cold and flu season."
What pollutants can cause ear infections in a baby?,"Remove as many environmental pollutants from your home as you can, including: Dust Cleaning fluid and solvents Tobacco smoke Also, reduce yours or your child's exposure to people with colds, and control allergies."
Can you use stevia as a cooking ingredient?,"Each brand has its own sugar-to-stevia ratio, so check the package before you measure out sweetener."
What is stage B heart failure?,"You're in this phase if you never had symptoms of heart failure but you're diagnosed with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which means the left chamber of your heart doesn't pump well. You may be in this group if you had or have: Heart attack Valve disease Cardiomyopathy Treatment will depend on your situation."
What is stage D heart failure?,"You're in this phase if you never had symptoms of heart failure but you're diagnosed with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which means the left chamber of your heart doesn't pump well."
How is stage A heart failure treated?,"When you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other heart and blood vessel conditions like coronary artery disease, you may need to take an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB)."
What causes heart failure?,Heart failure can be brought on by many conditions that damage the heart.
How can a heart attack cause heart failure?,"Heart attack may happen when a coronary artery is blocked suddenly, which stops the flow of blood to your heart muscle."
What are the symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)?,"The first signs of PML can be different from person to person, depending on the nerves that are damaged first. But they often include: Clumsiness or loss of coordination Difficulty walking Facial drooping Loss of vision Personality changes Trouble speaking Weak muscles Sometimes, PML can also cause seizures."
How do doctors diagnose progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)?,"If your doctor thinks you might have PML, he'll scan your brain with a magnetic resonance imaging machine ( MRI). This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make a detailed picture. He'll look for lesions -- spots of damaged tissue -- that show the disease is there. If an MRI doesn't give a clear picture, he might do a brain biopsy. He'll take a small sample of tissue from your brain to look at under a microscope for signs of the disease. Your doctor might also take a sample of the fluid around your brain and spinal cord by using a spinal tap -- a needle put into your lower back."
Is my stress affecting my poop?,"The digestive system is especially sensitive to stress, and constipation can be one response. Whether it's for business or pleasure, travel is stressful. When it disrupts your regular routines, especially eating patterns, your pooping can get off-schedule as well."
How does pregnancy affect how I poop?,"That's especially true during pregnancy, when hormone changes can easily throw off your digestive system. Add the pressure a growing baby puts on your plumbing, and it's no surprise you have trouble going. Problems with pooping are also common after childbirth. What about my age? The chance of having trouble moving your bowels goes up as you get older, so make a point to get more exercise, drink more water, and eat more fiber."
How can I get more fiber?,"Moving your bowels regularly takes fiber -- lots of it. We're talking about 3 to 5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day. Go easy on meat and dairy and load up on produce. Just be sure you add it to your diet gradually. Skip fast and prepared foods. They may be quick and easy, but they're almost always low in fiber."
How long does traveler's diarrhea usually last?,The typical symptoms of traveler's diarrhea include: Abrupt onset of diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Bloating Urgent need to have a bowel movement Malaise (weakness or discomfort) Explosive and painful gas Cramps Loss of appetite Traveler's diarrhea usually lasts from 3 to 7 days and is rarely life threatening.
What is required when treating traveler's diarrhea?,The most important treatment requires the replacement of fluids and salts lost from diarrhea. This is best achieved by use of an oral rehydration solution such as the World Health Organization oral rehydration salts ( ORS) solution. ORS packets are available at stores or pharmacies in almost all developing countries. ORS is prepared by adding one packet to boiled or treated water. Packet instructions should be followed carefully to ensure that the salts are added to the correct volume of water. ORS solution should be consumed or discarded within 12 hours if stored at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated.
When should you call the doctor about traveler's diarrhea?,"Immediate medical attention is required if an infant with diarrhea develops signs of moderate to severe dehydration (including dry mouth, eyes, and skin), confusion; sunken eyes; and fever, bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 F. Seek medical help for traveler's diarrhea if: Diarrhea is severe, bloody, or does not resolve within a few days Diarrhea is accompanied by fever and chills You are unable to keep fluids down to prevent dehydration In areas with poor sanitation, only the following beverages may be safe to drink: boiled water, hot beverages (such as coffee or tea) made with boiled water, canned or bottled carbonated beverages, beer, and wine."
How can I avoid traveler's diarrhea from tap water?,"Where water may be contaminated, you should not brush your teeth with tap water. Boiling is the most reliable method to make water safe to drink."
What are side effects of Pepto-Bismol for treating traveler's diarrhea?,"Side effects of Pepto- Bismol can include temporary blackening of tongue and stools, occasional nausea, constipation, and rarely, ringing in the ears. Do not take Pepto- Bismol if you have an aspirin allergy, renal insufficiency, gout, or if you are taking anticoagulants, probenecid ( Benemid, Probalan), or methotrexate ( Rheumatrex)."
How do you treat traveler's diarrhea?,"As with all diseases, it is best to consult a doctor rather than attempting to self-medicate for traveler's diarrhea. This is especially relevant for pregnant women and children."
How are antibiotics used to treat traveler's diarrhea?,"Antibiotics such as cirpofloxacin ( Cipro), norfloxacin ( Noroxin), rifamycin ( Amecolo), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( Bactrim, Septra), and or may shorten the length of illness. The CDC does not recommend the use of most antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, with the exception of azithromycin ( Zithromax), because they can sometimes cause additional problems. Azithromycin is specificately used to treat traveler's diarrhea. Consult your doctor about taking these medications."
How can you protect yourself from traveler's diarrhea?,"Immediate medical attention is required if an infant with diarrhea develops signs of moderate to severe dehydration (including dry mouth, eyes, and skin), confusion; sunken eyes; and fever, bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 F. Seek medical help for traveler's diarrhea if: Diarrhea is severe, bloody, or does not resolve within a few days Diarrhea is accompanied by fever and chills You are unable to keep fluids down to prevent dehydration In areas with poor sanitation, only the following beverages may be safe to drink: boiled water, hot beverages (such as coffee or tea) made with boiled water, canned or bottled carbonated beverages, beer, and wine. Avoid ice, as it may have been made from contaminated water. It is safer to drink from an unopened can or bottle than from a container that is not known to be clean and dry. Water on the surface of a beverage can or bottle may also be contaminated. Therefore, the area of a can or bottle that will touch the mouth should be wiped clean and dried. Where water may be contaminated, you should not brush your teeth with tap water."
How can I use iodine to avoid traveler's diarrhea?,"For disinfection with iodine, use either tincture of iodine or tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, such as Globaline or Potable- Aqua. These disinfectants can be found in sporting goods stores and pharmacies. Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions. If the water is cloudy, strain it through a clean cloth and double the number of disinfectant tablets added. If the water is very cold, either warm it or allow increased time for the disinfectant to work. Adding a pinch of salt or pouring water from one container to another will improve the taste."
How is traveler's diarrhea treated in children and infants?,"It is important for an infected person to consult a doctor about treating diarrhea in children and infants, because some of the drugs mentioned above are not recommended for children. The greatest risk for children, especially infants, is dehydration. Again, the best treatment for dehydration is the ORS solution."
Where are you most likely to get traveler's diarrhea?,"The risk of infection varies depending on the type of exposure -- from a fairly low risk from eating hot, cooked foods and drinking factory-sealed beverages to a higher risk from eating raw vegetables and fruits and drinking tap water. The most common culprit is a bacteria called E.coli. The typical symptoms of traveler's diarrhea include: Abrupt onset of diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Bloating Urgent need to have a bowel movement Malaise (weakness or discomfort) Explosive and painful gas Cramps Loss of appetite Traveler's diarrhea usually lasts from 3 to 7 days and is rarely life threatening."
What are challenges that come with treating elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by medications?,"These include: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) Biologic drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Corticosteroids You might have more challenges with your medication, especially if you take drugs for other health conditions. This boosts your chances of a bad reaction to the medicine. You may also have a harder time with drug side effects. NSAIDs increase your chances of heart, brain, gut, and kidney problems. Corticosteroids up the odds of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and other health problems."
What symptoms of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) might be a different condition?,"Elderly-onset RA also has symptoms that overlap with other diseases, like: Polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) Late-onset psoriatic arthritis Crystal arthritis Viral arthritis Osteoarthritis Rotator cuff tendinitis Hypothyroidism Parkinson's disease It may be hardest to tell elderly-onset RA from PMR, which has similar aches and test results (like elevated CRP and ESR levels)."
Does exercise help if you have elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,Your doctor has to figure out if it's really late-onset or if you've had the disease for years.
What is the goal of treatment for elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Your treatment goal is remission, the lowest possible level of disease activity. This can prevent joint damage and can keep your joints working like they should."
How do new gum disease treatments lead to a better dental health?,"When the supporting tissue and bone around your teeth doesn't fit snugly, ""pockets"" form in the gums. Bacteria then invade these pockets, increasing bone destruction and tooth loss. A variety of treatments can help reverse the damage. They range from cleaning the root surfaces to remove plaque and tartar to more extreme measures such as gum surgery to reduce the pockets. In recent years, the focus of gum disease treatment has expanded beyond reducing the pockets and removing the bacteria to include regenerative procedures. For instance, lasers, membranes, bone grafts, or proteins that stimulate tissue growth can be used to help regenerate bone and tissue to combat the gum disease."
How does computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology benefit my dental health?,"The CAD in this technology stands for âcomputer-assisted design,â and the CAM for âcomputer-assisted manufacture.â Together, they translate into fewer dental visits to complete procedures such as crowns and bridges. Traditionally when a patient needs a crown, a dentist must make a mold of the tooth and fashion a temporary crown, then wait for the dental laboratory to make a permanent one. With CAD/ CAM technology, the tooth is drilled to prepare it for the crown and a picture is taken with a computer. This image is then relayed to a machine that makes the crown right in the office."
How can thinner veneers improve my dental health?,"Veneers are the thin, custom-made shells or moldings that are used to cover the front of crooked or otherwise unattractive teeth. New materials now make it possible to create even thinner veneers that are just as strong. What's the advantage for you? Preparing a tooth for a veneer - which involves reshaping the tooth to allow for the added thickness of the veneer -- can be minimal with the thinner veneers. Less of the tooth surface must be reduced and more of the natural tooth is kept intact."
What is Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Tumors with tiny new blood vessels grow below the surface of the skin and in membranes of your mouth, nose, eyes, and anus. It can spread to your lungs, liver, stomach, intestines, and lymph nodes, which are glands that help you fight infection. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. It affects 8 times more men than women. It may spread through sexual contact, but we don't know for sure. KS was once rare, affecting older men from Eastern European or Mediterranean families, young African men, or people who had undergone organ transplants. Now HIV is the most common cause."
What is surgical biopsy?,"Doctors rarely use this method on the thyroid. It requires making an opening in your neck to remove the node. It may even mean removing half your thyroid. Because it's surgery, you'll get medicines to put you under during the operation. It also means a longer recovery."
What is follow-up for a peritonsillar abscess?,"Arrange follow-up with your doctor or an ear-nose-throat specialist (otolaryngologist) after treatment for a peritonsillar abscess. Also: If the abscess starts to return, you may need a different antibiotic or further drainage. If you develop excessive bleeding or have trouble breathing or swallowing, seek medical attention immediately."
What are the options for treating a peritonsillar abscess?,"The doctor has several options for treating you: Needle aspiration involves slowly putting a needle into the abscess and withdrawing the pus into a syringe. Incision and drainage involves using a scalpel to make a small cut in the abscess so pus can drain. Acute tonsillectomy (having a surgeon remove your tonsils) may be needed if, for some reason, you cannot tolerate a drainage procedure, or if you have a history of frequent tonsillitis."
What are risk factors for peritonsillar abscess?,Dental infection (such as the gum infections periodontitis and gingivitis) may be a risk factor. Other risk factors include: Chronic tonsillitis Infectious mononucleosis Smoking Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) Stones or calcium deposits in the tonsils (tonsilloliths) The first symptom of a peritonsillar abscess is usually a sore throat.
How is a peritonsillar abscess usually diagnosed?,"A peritonsillar abscess is easy to diagnose when it is large enough to see. The doctor will look into your mouth using a light and, possibly, a tongue depressor. Swelling and redness on one side of the throat near the tonsil suggests an abscess. The doctor may also gently push on the area with a gloved finger to see if there is pus from infection inside."
How do you know if you have pustular psoriasis?,You'll see white bumps filled with pus near or inside red skin blotches.
What increases my chances of getting peptic ulcer?,"You can have ulcers at any age, but your chances go up as you get older."
How can bacteria cause peptic ulcers?,"It's called Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori), and as many as half of us carry it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts aren't sure how H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing. You may also get it from unclean food and water."
How is peptic ulcer diagnosed?,"Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. She'll also check you for bloating in the belly and pain. That may be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have an ulcer is to look. She may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy. This test allows her to pass a thin, bendy tube down your throat and into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a camera at the end so she can check the lining for ulcers. She may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori. Blood, breath, and stool sample tests also can screen for the bacteria."
How are peptic ulcers treated?,"But if you don't treat them, the ulcers tend to come back. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal."
When should I call my doctor about bursitis?,"Common symptoms of bursitis include: Pain and (rarely) swelling in the shoulders, elbows, hips, or knees, particularly stretching or extending the joint while exercising, lifting, or otherwise pushing the joint to its limits Restricted or lost range of motion in a joint, especially affecting the shoulder, with or without immediate pain Muscle weakness due to pain Pain in or near a joint persists more than two weeks. You are unable to move the affected area. You have unusual swelling near a joint, such as the elbow. You have a fever with your bursitis symptoms."
What are disadvantages of rigid gas-permeable lenses?,"the lenses don't feel as comfortable as soft contacts. It takes longer to get used to them, so you need to wear them every day."
What are risks of soft contact lenses?,"Soft contact lens material can absorb particles, chemicals, bacteria, and mold more easily than both hard and rigid gas-permeable lenses. They soak up all kinds of things that can irritate your eyes -- smoke and sprays in the air and lotion or soap on your hands. Soft contacts are also more fragile. They can rip or tear more easily than hard or gas-permeable lenses."
What are color tint lenses?,"Color tint lenses are darker, opaque, and change the color of your eyes. Specialty colors include amethyst, violet, and green."
What are visibility tint lenses?,Visibility tint lenses have a tiny bit of color so you can find your lens if you drop it. It isn't enough to affect the color of your eyes.
What are advantages of rigid gas-permeable lenses?,You might see better than you do with soft lenses. They correct substantial astigmatism. They're easy to take care of and durable.
What are rigid gas-permeable lenses?,"As the name suggests, these are stiffer than soft contacts. They're made from silicone, and they're designed to let oxygen pass through to your cornea."
What are enhancement tint lenses?,Enhancement tint lenses play up your natural eye color.
What are daily disposables?,"Daily disposables are soft contacts that you wear only for a day and then throw away. That means you don't have to clean them regularly or risk dry eyes and irritation from contact solutions. If you have allergies, they may be the best choice for you."
What contact lenses can reshape your cornea?,"But the results only last while you have the contact in. This procedure isn't widely used, because laser vision correction offers the same result in less time and is permanent. Laser surgery is now OK for professionals -- like members of the military or airline pilots -- whose jobs didn't allow them to have it in the past. If you can't have laser surgery, ask your eye care professional if ortho-k could work for you."
Why I am getting erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"There are a lot of reasons you can get ED, from high blood pressure and diabetes to alcohol and drug use to a hormone imbalance. It could even be due to an injury to your penis, prostate, bladder, and pelvis. But it's not always physical. Psychological and emotional issues are sometimes to blame, as well. Stress, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem can cause ED. Even nervousness about how you perform sexually can make it happen. Some medications may make getting an erection difficult, too. Your doctor can help you figure out what's going on and how to solve it."
What do the results of the B-type natriuretic peptide blood test mean?,The level of BNP tends to increase as heart failure gets worse. But it can also increase with age. Testing BNP levels is one of the most sensitive ways to show how well you're doing on heart failure treatment. Ask your doctor to explain the results of your BNP tests.
What happens during a B-type natriuretic peptide blood test?,"A small amount of blood will be taken from you. Then it's placed in a machine that reads the level of BNP and NT-pro- BNP. The test takes about 15 minutes. In some places, the blood sample needs to be sent away to a lab to be tested."
Why is a B-type natriuretic peptide  blood test needed?,"BNP levels help your doctor figure out if you have heart failure or something else that has similar symptoms such as shortness of breath. The test also shows if your heart failure has worsened. It'll help your doctor decide what treatments you need and if you need to be hospitalized. It may also give him a look into what the future may hold. It is a sensitive test to allow the doctor to evaluate improvement or worsening of heart failure and to help monitor whether or not the medication is working well. Depending on your medical center, you may get tested for one or both proteins."
What happens with osteoarthritis?,"What happens: You lose your body's shock absorber. Cartilage, the slippery material that covers the ends of bones, gradually breaks down. One example is what can happen to your knees when you're overweight. The extra pounds put more pressure on the cartilage as it gets squeezed between the bones. It gets damaged and wears away, so there isn't as much left to cushion the joint. The damaged cartilage makes movement painful. You may hear a grating sound when the roughened cartilage on the surface of the bones rubs together. You may get painful spurs or bumps on the end of the bones, especially on fingers and feet. The joint lining can get inflamed, but it's not common with osteoarthritis."
What are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?,"Symptoms: Psoriatic arthritis can swell the fingers and toes. People who have it often have fingernails that are pitted or discolored, too. In some people, only one joint or a few joints are affected. For example, you could have it in only one knee. Sometimes, it affects the spine or just the fingers and toes."
What are symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"Symptoms depend on which joint or joints are affected. You may have: Deep, aching pain Trouble dressing, combing your hair, gripping things, bending over, squatting, or climbing stairs, depending on which joints are involved Morning stiffness that typically lasts less than 30 minutes Pain when walking Stiffness after resting Your joint may be: Warm to the touch Swollen and harder to move Unable to move through a full range of motion What is it?"
What happens in psoriatic arthritis?,"What happens: This type of arthritis usually starts between ages 30 and 50, but it can start as early as childhood. It's equally common among men and women. The skin disease (psoriasis) usually shows up first."
What is psoriatic arthritis?,"People with this condition have inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). Psoriasis causes patchy, raised, red and white areas of inflamed skin with scales. It usually affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the scalp, the navel, and skin around the genital areas or anus. Only about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis will also get psoriatic arthritis."
What is osteoarthritis?,"More people have this condition than any other form of arthritis. It's the ""wear and tear"" that happens when your joints are overused. It usually happens with age, but it can also come from joint injuries or obesity, which puts extra stress on your joints. Joints that bear weight -- like your knees, hips, feet, and spine -- are the most common places it affects. It often comes on gradually over months or years. It makes the affected joint hurt. But you don't feel sick or have the fatigue that comes with some other types of arthritis."
What happens if you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"What happens: Doctors don't know exactly what causes RA. Some experts believe the immune system becomes ""confused"" after an infection with a bacteria or virus and starts to attack your joints. This battle can spread to other areas of the body. Scientists think two of the body's chemicals that are related to inflammation, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) and interleukin-1, trigger other parts of the immune system in rheumatoid arthritis. Medicines that block TNF, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 can improve the symptoms and prevent joint damage."
When should I see a doctor right away about my drug allergy?,"Difficulty breathing or wheezing Tightness in the throat or a feeling that the airways are closing Hoarseness or trouble speaking Swollen lips, tongue, or throat Nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting Fast heartbeat or pulse Anxiety or dizziness Loss of consciousness Hives and trouble breathing Other symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) Had severe reactions in the past See a doctor immediately for these symptoms: A fast-spreading painful red or blistered area on the skin Swollen face, tongue, or lips, even without breathing difficulty or increase in swelling Top layer of skin peels off in sheets without blistering Scalded-looking raw areas of flesh Discomfort Fever Condition spreading to eyes, mouth, and genitals Call the doctor as soon as possible if the person has: Skin rash, itching, a feeling of warmth, or hives See Severe Allergic Reaction Treatment."

How can I control itching caused by drug allergy?,"For a mild reaction: Give an adult an over-the-counter antihistamine. Check with a doctor before giving an antihistamine to a child. Use cool compresses on the area or have the person take cool showers. Avoid strong soaps, detergents, and other chemicals. Stay in a cool room. Have the person wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothes. For a rash, apply calamine lotion."
How can reducing cholesterol help improve your erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"You can lower your cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medication."
Is there anything I can do to prevent diabetes?,"The medications metformin ( Glucophage), pioglitazone ( Actos), exenatide ( Byetta, Bydureon), and acarbose ( Precose) have also been shown to be effective in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes in those at risk."
Are there any treatments that help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at risk?,"The medications metformin ( Glucophage), pioglitazone ( Actos), exenatide ( Byetta, Bydureon), and acarbose ( Precose) have also been shown to be effective in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes in those at risk."
How can I prevent the development of type 2 diabetes?,"In fact, studies have shown that exercise and a healthy diet can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in people with pre-diabetes -- a condition that often develops prior to full-blown type 2 diabetes."
What medications can help prevent type 2 diabetes?,"The medications metformin ( Glucophage), pioglitazone ( Actos), exenatide ( Byetta, Bydureon), and acarbose ( Precose) have also been shown to be effective in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes in those at risk."
How can I prevent type 2 diabetes?,"Because of the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes, you can do a great deal to reduce your chance of developing the disease by slimming down if you are overweight. This is especially true if diabetes runs in your family."
How common is pelvic organ prolapse (POP)?,"Nearly half of all women between ages 50 and 79 have at least a little bit of pelvic organ prolapse ( POP). It doesn't always cause symptoms, so you could actually have it and not know it. Men can get POP, too, if their bladders or rectums drop down."
Can pelvic organ prolapse (POP) have complications?,"Other things can raise your risk, like: Having surgery or radiation on your pelvic area Breaking your back or the bones in your pelvis Chronic constipation, because of the pushing and straining Chronic cough (it puts pressure on your pelvic organs) Obesity Doing a lot of heavy lifting over and over Getting older Having family members who have it Being white Having a hysterectomy Giving birth for the first time at a young age Smoking Pelvic organ prolapse is rarely life threatening. But it can cause a few problems, such as: Bladder control problems (urinary incontinence) A kink in the urethra, the tube that carries your urine outside your body. This can make it hard to pee. Bowel control problems (fecal incontinence), with liquid or solid stools coming out Problems having bowel movements when stools get trapped Pain during sex Urinary tract infections Kidney damage if it blocks your pee There are things you can to do tighten your pelvic muscles and reduce your risk."
What is your pelvis?,Some of your body tissue can stick out of your vagina.
What causes pelvic organ prolapse (POP)?,"If you delivered a baby through your vagina (not by C-section), you have the biggest risk for POP. The more times you give birth, the higher your risk. But just because you've had babies, doesn't mean you're going to have a prolapse."
What is pelvic organ prolapse (POP?,"Sometimes, the muscles and other kinds of tissue that hold everything in place get stretched out, weak, or torn. When that happens, some of your body parts can drop down below where they're supposed to be. Some of your body tissue can stick out of your vagina. This is called prolapse. It can affect all the organs in your pelvis."
What can raise your risk of pelvic organ prolapse (POP)?,"Other things can raise your risk, like: Having surgery or radiation on your pelvic area Breaking your back or the bones in your pelvis Chronic constipation, because of the pushing and straining Chronic cough (it puts pressure on your pelvic organs) Obesity Doing a lot of heavy lifting over and over Getting older Having family members who have it Being white Having a hysterectomy Giving birth for the first time at a young age Smoking Pelvic organ prolapse is rarely life threatening."
Can I prevent pelvic organ prolapse (POP)?,"Bowel control problems (fecal incontinence), with liquid or solid stools coming out Problems having bowel movements when stools get trapped Pain during sex Urinary tract infections Kidney damage if it blocks your pee There are things you can to do tighten your pelvic muscles and reduce your risk. For instance, Kegel exercises can help strengthen the nerves and muscles in your pelvis. Making certain lifestyle changes might help, too. If you're overweight, for example, try to shed some pounds. Overweight women are more likely to get POP than those who maintain a healthy weight. Drink lots of fluids and eat high-fiber foods. This will help you to avoid constipation. Remember, constantly pushing and straining will only make the prolapse worse. Try not to lift anything heavy. If you must, learn to lift the right way --with your legs, not your back or abs. If you smoke, stop. Smoking increases your risk of POP. And see a doctor about any health issues you might have, like a cough that won't go away. Coughing puts pressure on your pelvic muscles and can make your prolapse worse."
When should you call a doctor about dehydration in children under 12 years?,"Has extremely dry mouth or no tears Is lethargic Is older and does not urinate in 12 or more hours Isn't alert or able to think clearly Passes out Is too weak or dizzy to stand In young children, mild to moderate dehydration can happen very easily, particularly if the child has diarrhea or is vomiting.

If you bottle feed, give your baby the usual amount of fluid, unless the baby is vomiting. If your baby is vomiting, give smaller amounts more frequently. For example, instead of 6 ounces every 4 hours, give 3 ounces every 2 hours. If she vomits more than once, call your doctor. If your baby eats solid food, cereal, strained bananas, and mashed potatoes, also provide fluids. Give an oral rehydration solution such as Pedialyte, if possible. It replaces salt, sugar, potassium, and other nutrients. Ask your doctor what type and quantity to use."
When should you call your doctor about loss of bladder or bowel control due to back pain?,"Loss of bladder or bowel control: If you have back pain and suddenly can't control your bladder or bowels, call your doctor right away. This could be a sign of several things, like spinal tumors or cauda equina syndrome, a rare but serious condition caused by a severe compression of the nerve roots in the spine. It could also signal lumbar spinal stenosis, which causes compression of the nerves in the lower back."
Should you call your doctor if you have a fever and back pain?,"Fever: When you have a high temperature and back pain, take it seriously. It could be the sign of a spinal infection, which needs urgent medical attention."
Should you call your doctor about radiating back pain?,"Radiating pain: Low back strains and sprains, sciatica, and a herniated disk can cause back pain to âradiateâ -- move to other parts of your body.

What is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"It is a rare condition of irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia. The heart has an electrical system that works a certain way. Signals travel in an exact pattern from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. This system keeps the heart beating regularly. People with Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome have an extra electrical pathway. It causes the abnormal heartbeats. And it could lead to a very serious arrhythmia called supraventricular tachycardia. This is when the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) beat very quickly."
What are symptoms of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,Some people have symptoms and some do not. You may have the following: Dizziness or feeling light-headed Palpitations or feeling your heart flutter or beat harder Loss of consciousness Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Your doctor will recommend that you see a cardiologist or heart specialist.
How can a Holter monitor help in the diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,You'll wear a monitor that records your heart rhythm for 24 hours or more.
What causes Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"Parents can pass it down to their children. But most times it happens randomly and doesn't run in families. If you have this condition, you also might have other heart problems. Even when you're born with the syndrome, you may not find out you have it until you're in your teens or older."
How is the blood pressure measure written and what does it mean?,"Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is written systolic over diastolic (for example, 120/80 mm Hg, or ""120 over 80""). According to the most recent guidelines, a normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure is 120 to 129 and less than 80. Hypertension is blood pressure that is greater than 130/80."
What treats are good for my dog if he has diabetes?,"Avoid snacks that list syrup, molasses, fructose, dextrose, or maltose on the ingredients label. Homemade dehydrated meats, carrots, snap peas, and even canned pumpkin are good options. Balancing insulin and food is like a relay race. The body constantly processes food and insulin between meals and injections."
Does regular exercise help dogs with diabetes?,Regular exercise will also help your pooch lose weight and lower blood sugar levels. It’s best to have your dog exercise for the same length of time and at the same intensity every day. An unusually long or vigorous workout could cause blood sugar levels to drop too low.
How can cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) cause stroke?,"Blood clots: Either kind of cardioversion could knock loose blood clots created from your abnormal heartbeat. Before the procedure, your doctor may do a type of ultrasound to look for blood clots in your heart. You'll probably get medicine to take for 3-4 weeks before and after the procedure to help prevent blood clots. Stroke : If a clot travels to your brain, it can cause a stroke."
How effective is cardioversion for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,It might not work: Cardioversion doesn't always fix a fast or irregular heartbeat. You may need medicine or a pacemaker to control things.
What is the success rate of electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"How well it works depends on the size of your left atrium as well as how long you've been in AFib. If you have a large left atrium or you've been in constant AFib for a year or two, it may not work as well. Taking antiarrhythmic drugs can also prevent AFib after a successful electrical cardioversion."
How does cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) work?,"Your doctor uses a special machine to send electrical energy to the heart muscle. The procedure restores a normal heart rate and rhythm, allowing your heart to pump better."
How can chemical cardioversion help with treating atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"Chemical cardioversion: If your arrhythmia isn't an emergency, a doctor will usually use medication to get your heart back to normal. This is called chemical or pharmacologic cardioversion. You typically get the medicine through an IV while doctors check your heart. But sometimes, people can take it as a pill."
What are the concerns about cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"It might make things worse: It's unlikely, but there's a small chance that cardioversion could damage your heart or lead to more arrhythmias. Irritated skin: This often happens where the paddles are applied. The doctor can give you a cream to treat it."
What is the success rate of chemical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"Chemical cardioversion: You should know quickly if it works. It usually takes effect within hours, but sometimes it takes days. If it doesn't work for you, the doctor might suggest electrical cardioversion."
How can electrical cardioversion help with treating for AFib?,"Electrical cardioversion gives shocks through paddles to regulate your heartbeat. First, you'll get medicine to make you fall asleep. Then, your doctor will put the paddles on your chest, and sometimes your back. These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal. Most people only need one. Because you're sedated, you probably won't remember being shocked. You can usually go home the same day."
How does cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) cause blood clots?,"Blood clots: Either kind of cardioversion could knock loose blood clots created from your abnormal heartbeat. Before the procedure, your doctor may do a type of ultrasound to look for blood clots in your heart.

Are antidepressants used to treat bipolar depression?,"While antidepressants are effective treatment for people with major depressive (unipolar) disorder, they are not always as effective for bipolar depression, and generally should not be given alone (monotherapy) in people with bipolar I disorder. When antidepressants are given alone to someone with bipolar disorder, there's a risk the drug might ignite a manic episode in some patients."
Is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) a viable treatment for bipolar depression?,"Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association suggest that ECT is an appropriate and sometimes preferred treatment for depressed bipolar patients who have psychotic symptoms or a very high risk for suicidal behavior. In addition, ECT may benefit women who are pregnant and suffer with severe bipolar depression or mania."
How do the CNS depressants help with bipolar disorder depression?,"CNS depressants are commonly used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders and may be an effective alternative or adjunctive therapy in some bipolar patients with acute mania. Some commonly used benzodiazepines include clonazepam ( Klonopin), lorazepam ( Ativan), alprazolam ( Xanax), and diazepam ( Valium). These drugs all can be addictive and can cause sluggish thinking. They generally should be used only to treat agitation or sleep problems during the acute phase of the illness and not as long-term medications. They typically should be tapered off rather than stopped abruptly, in order to minimize the risk of drug withdrawal."
Can psychotherapy  help with bipolar depression?,"In addition, ECT may benefit women who are pregnant and suffer with severe bipolar depression or mania. Along with medications for bipolar depression, patients may benefit from ongoing psychotherapy. This one-on-one therapy combines interpersonal psychotherapy with behavioral techniques to help patients learn how to more effectively manage interpersonal problems, stay on their medications, and normalize their lifestyle habits. The STEP- BD study mentioned earlier found that in addition to medications, adding a structured psychotherapy -- such as cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal/social rhythm therapy, or family-focused therapy -- can speed up treatment response in bipolar depression by as much as 150%."
What tests are used to diagnose schizoaffective disorder?,There are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose schizoaffective disorder. So doctors rely on your medical history and your answers to certain questions.
What are symptoms of depression in schizoaffective disorder?,"In order to get diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, you must have: Periods of uninterrupted illness An episode of mania, major depression, or a mix of both Symptoms of schizophrenia At least two periods of psychotic symptoms, each lasting 2 weeks."

What can cause schizoaffective disorder?,"Trouble at work, school, or in social settings Scientists don't know the exact cause. Risk factors for schizoaffective disorder include: Genetics: You may inherit a tendency to get features linked to schizoaffective disorder from your parents. Brain chemistry and structure: If you have schizophrenia and mood disorders, you might have problems with brain circuits that manage mood and thinking. Schizophrenia is also tied to lower levels of dopamine, a brain chemical that also helps manage these tasks. Environment: Some scientists think things like viral infections or highly stressful situations could play a part in getting schizoaffective disorder if you're at risk for it. How that happens isn't clear."
What are symptoms of schizophrenia in schizoaffective disorder?,"Schizoaffective disorder has the features of schizophrenia, like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, along with those of a mood disorder, like mania and depression."
How is schizoaffective disorder often misdiagnosed?,"Because schizoaffective disorder combines symptoms that reflect two mental illnesses, it's easily confused with other psychotic or mood disorders. Some doctors may diagnose schizophrenia. Others may think it's a mood disorder. As a result, it's hard to know how many people actually have schizoaffective disorder. It's probably less common than either schizophrenia or mood disorders alone."
How do I find out the cause of my wheezing?,"For example, if you have no history of lung disease and you always wheeze after eating a certain food or at a certain time of year, the doctor may suspect that you have a food or respiratory allergy. The doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear where the wheezing is and how much wheezing you have. If this is the first time you've been evaluated, your doctor will probably ask you to perform a breathing test (spirometry) and may also order a chest X-ray. Other blood tests and procedures may be necessary, depending on what the doctor learns from interviewing and examining you. If it seems like allergies may be related to your wheezing, there are a variety of other tests your doctor may use to verify allergies, including skin testing or blood tests. First off, see a doctor to determine the cause of your wheezing and then receive treatment for the specific cause."
When should you call 911 about wheezing?,"In emergencies, a medical team may administer any of the following: A shot of epinephrine to open clogged respiratory passages Oxygen A corticosteroid (such as methylprednisolone or prednisone) Frequent or continuous nebulizer (breathing) treatments A mechanical ventilator to help you breathe"
What are the treatments for wheezing if it is caused by asthma?,"First off, see a doctor to determine the cause of your wheezing and then receive treatment for the specific cause. If wheezing is caused by asthma, your doctor may recommend some or all of the following to reduce inflammation and open the airways: A fast-acting bronchodilator inhaler -- albuterol ( Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol ( Xopenex) -- to dilate constricted airways when you have respiratory symptoms An inhaled corticosteroid -- beclomethasone ( Qvar), budesonide ( Pulmicort), ciclesonide ( Alvesco), flunisolide ( Aerospan), fluticasone ( Flovent), mometasone ( Asmanex) A long-acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination -- budesonide/formoterol ( Symbicort), fluticasone/salmeterol ( Advair) A long-acting anticholinergic -- tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva Respimat).

When should you get help for facial fracture?,"You need to see a health care provider for a facial fracture, including broken nose, jaw, cheekbone, or eye socket."
What is the outlook for costochondritis?,"Noninfectious costochondritis will go away on its own, with or without anti-inflammatory treatment. Most people will recover fully. Infectious costochondritis responds well to IV antibiotics and surgical repair, but recovery may take a long time."
What tests are used to determine if an infection is causing costochondritis?,"To determine if infection is the cause of chest pain, doctors will: Look for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pus, and drainage at the site of surgery Order a more sophisticated imaging study of the chest called a gallium scan, which will show increased uptake of the radioactive material gallium in an area of infection Check the white blood cell count to see if it is elevated, a sign of infection Order a chest X-ray if pneumonia is a suspected cause of chest pain Order an ECG and other tests if a heart problem is suspected Costochondritis is a less common cause of chest pain in adults but occurs fairly frequently in people who have had cardiac surgery."
How does costochondritis differ from Tietze syndrome?,"Tietze syndrome is often referred to as costochondritis, but the two are distinct conditions. You can tell the difference by noting the following: Tietze syndrome is rare. It usually comes on abruptly, with chest pain radiating to your arms or shoulder and lasting several weeks. Tietze syndrome is accompanied by a localized swelling at the painful area (the junction of the ribs and breastbone)."
How can you prevent costochondritis?,Costochondritis is an inflammatory process but usually has no definite cause.
What are some home remedies for costochondritis?,"The following home remedies may provide relief from costochondritis: Taking pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve) as needed Using local heat or ice to relieve pain Avoiding unnecessary exercise or activities that make the symptoms worse; avoiding contact sports until there is improvement in symptoms, and then returning to normal activities only as tolerated Doing stretching exercises Costochondritis responds to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil or Motrin) and naproxen ( Aleve)."
When should you go to a hospital for costochondritis?,"Call the doctor for any of the following symptoms: Trouble breathing High fever Signs of infection such as redness, pus, and increased swelling at the rib joints Continuing or worsening pain despite medication Nausea Sweating Dizziness Go to a hospital's emergency room if you have difficulty breathing or any of the following symptoms occur. These symptoms are generally not associated with costochondritis: High fever not responding to fever-reducers such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil) Signs of infection at the tender spot, such as pus, redness, increased pain, and swelling Persistent chest pain of any type associated with nausea, sweating, left arm pain, or any generalized chest pain that is not well localized. These may be signs of a heart attack. If you are not sure what is causing your condition, always go to the emergency room."
How is costochondritis compared to Tietze syndrome?,"Although some doctors use the terms costochondritis and Tietze syndrome interchangeably, Tietze syndrome has a sudden onset without any preceding respiratory illness or any history of minor trauma. In Tietze syndrome, there is frequently radiation of pain to arms and shoulders, as well as pain and tenderness associated with swelling at the spot that hurts."

What are eye-related symptoms of Graves' disease?,"Graves' ophthalmopathy can cause a wide range of issues with your eyes. Some people might have a little redness and minor pain, while others have strong swelling, dryness, and more severe pain.

In rare cases, you can have double vision or other problems with your sight."
How are eye problems related to Graves' disease diagnosed?,"If you know you have Graves', your doctor should be able to find out if you have the eye problem with a standard eye exam. In some cases, you may need blood tests, or imaging tests like a computerized tomography ( CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scan. With a CT scan, X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to make a more complete picture. And an MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images. If you haven't been diagnosed with Graves' disease, step one probably will be to get your thyroid hormone levels checked with a simple blood test."
Why do people with Graves' disease have eye issues?,"About half of people with Graves' disease notice some eye issues, and some have severe vision problems. Experts think this happens because the tissues in your eyes have proteins like ones in your thyroid gland. The problem is known as Graves' eye disease or Graves' ophthalmopathy. Doctors don't think it can be prevented, but you're more likely to get it -- and have a worse case of it -- if you smoke."
What are the symptoms of eye problems related to Graves' disease?,"Graves' ophthalmopathy can cause a wide range of issues with your eyes. Some people might have a little redness and minor pain, while others have strong swelling, dryness, and more severe pain. It's also possible to have bulging eyes -- because your muscles swell and your eyes are pushed out -- and pressure may build up in your eye socket. In rare cases, you can have double vision or other problems with your sight. Most people with the condition notice eye symptoms within 6 months (before or after) of being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. People who have severe hyperthyroidism aren't necessarily more likely to have eye trouble than those who have milder cases."
"If I think I'm getting Graves' disease and it's affecting my eyes, what kind of doctor do I need to see?","If you think you may be developing Graves' ophthalmopathy, you may need to see both an endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in problems with hormones) and an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). If you know you have Graves', your doctor should be able to find out if you have the eye problem with a standard eye exam."
How are eye problems related to Graves' disease treated?,"A number of things can help: Artificial tears, gels, and ointments can go a long way toward easing dryness. If you have a lot of swelling -- especially if it leads to double vision or loss of vision -- you might need to take a steroid called prednisone for a few weeks to bring the swelling down. In the rare cases when these don't work, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove some tissue from your eye socket or radiation therapy, where high-energy X-rays are aimed at the eye muscle. Graves' ophthalmopathy tends to get better after a few years, but you may have eye problems that need to be corrected with surgery. For example, you might need surgery to ease pain and pressure on your optic nerve, fix the alignment of your eye muscles, or make sure your eyelids cover and protect your eyes."
