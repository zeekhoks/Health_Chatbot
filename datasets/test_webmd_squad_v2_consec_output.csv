They can help you look for new solutions to make your life better."
What are the 11 signs of lupus?,"Your doctor may say you have lupus if you have at least four of 11 signs of the disease that are laid out by experts at the American College of Rheumatology: Butterfly-shaped rash Raised red patches on your skin You're sensitive to light Ulcers in your mouth or nose Arthritis in two or more joints, plus swelling or tenderness Inflammation in the lining of your heart or lungs Seizures or other nerve problems Too much protein in your urine Low blood cell counts Certain antibodies in your blood Results from a blood test called an ANA test that suggest you may have too many ""antinuclear"" antibodies, which could be a sign of lupus To check if you have psoriatic arthritis, you may need to get certain tests like X-rays to look at changes in your bones or joints, and blood tests that check for inflammation."
What are some symptoms of lupus?,"Some things you may notice if you have lupus are: A rash shaped like a butterfly that covers your nose and cheeks You feel tired Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints Fever Sensitivity to sun or light that causes skin lesions White or blue color in your fingers and toes when you're in the cold or feel stressed Headaches or chest pain Ulcers in your mouth or nose Hair loss Low numbers of blood cells (anemia) Swelling in your hands, feet, or legs Like lupus, your symptoms sometimes get better and sometimes flare up."
How does lupus affect people differently?,"Lupus affects everybody differently. The way you feel may not be the same as your friend who also has the disease. Most folks will get flares, which means the condition gets worse at certain times and then gets better. The symptoms can come on slowly or suddenly, and can be permanent or temporary."
What can trigger lupus?,"Experts don't know the exact cause of lupus. They think it may be related to genes that put you at risk for lupus and things you come into contact with that trigger the disease. Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales."
What causes psoriatic arthritis?,"Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales. Sometimes people get psoriasis first and then have psoriatic arthritis later, but others get the arthritis symptoms first. Like lupus, psoriatic arthritis happens when your immune system attacks your healthy cells and tissues. This causes your joints to get inflamed and your skin to make too many cells. It's not clear what causes the immune system to attack your body when you have psoriatic arthritis, but just like lupus, it's likely that genes and triggers play a role."
What causes lupus?,"If you have psoriatic arthritis you may get problems like: Severe swelling in your fingers or toes Foot pain, often at the bottom or the heel Pain in your lower back Scaly patches on your skin that flake Pitted or discolored nails It starts when your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your own organs and tissues. The disease causes inflammation and can affect different parts of your body, including your heart, skin, brain, and blood cells."
How are psoriatic arthritis and lupus similar?,"If you've got pain and swelling in your joints, it could be a sign of either disease."
How can I practice deep breathing?,"Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Then close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, filling up your lungs. Hold for a few seconds. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Let all the air out of your lungs like you're letting air out of a balloon. Repeat many times."
How can hobbies help alleviate stress for people with diabetes?,"Fight stress by forgetting about it. Lose yourself in a favorite pastime. Do something that relaxes you, like reading or painting."
How can exercise help alleviate stress for people with diabetes?,"Exercise. Think about what kinds of exercise help you relieve stress. For some people, running and hard-hitting sports push away their worries. For others, taking a quiet walk or a bike ride is calming. Exercise doesn't just help you fight stress. It can lower your blood pressure and help you lose any extra pounds. Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise program. Ask what type of exercise might be best for you."
Can stress affect my diabetes?,"Manage Diabetes With Stress Reduction If you try different relaxation methods you can learn how to ease and prevent stress. That can help you take care of your health. Stress hormones can raise your blood sugar. When you can take care of stress, you can lower your blood sugar. Plus, with less stress you can have the energy you need to eat right, exercise, and check your blood sugar. Having ways to bust stress can also help you sleep better."
How can yoga help alleviate stress for people with diabetes?,"Slowly relax into a downward dog pose or a warrior's pose. This forces you to focus on your breathing, stretching, and how you place your body. It loosens tight muscles and turns your thoughts away from the stresses in your life. Consider taking a yoga class at a gym or a local community center. Or, do a yoga routine through an active video game on a system like the Wii. If you don't have time for a full class, even 5 or 10 minutes of yoga posing or breathing can help ease stress."
How do you make memories?,"For something to become a memory, three functions must occur, including: Acquisition -- learning or experiencing something new Consolidation -- the memory becomes stable in the brain Recall -- having the ability to access the memory in the future Both acquisition and recall are functions that take place when you are awake. However, researchers believe sleep is required for consolidation of a memory, no matter the memory type."
What happens when you sleep?,"Scientists don't know exactly how sleep enhances memory, but it appears to involve the brain's hippocampus and neocortex -- the part of the brain where long-term memories are stored. It is thought that during sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, where it reviews and processes memories, helping them to last for the long term."
What does sleep affect?,"Studies show that sleep affects physical reflexes, fine motor skills, and judgment, too. One study showed that participants who were sleep deprived were more likely to think they were right when they were, in fact, wrong. Studies involving memory tests show that after a single night of sleep, or even a nap, people perform better, whether on a test, in the office, on the athletic field, or in a concert hall."
Why is sleep important for memory?,Imaging and behavioral studies continue to show the critical role sleep plays in learning and memory. Researchers believe that sleep affects learning and memory in two ways: Lack of sleep impairs a person's ability to focus and learn efficiently. Sleep is necessary to consolidate a memory (make it stick) so that it can be recalled in the future.
What are tips to help you get more sleep?,"Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Get regular exercise, but do not exercise close to bedtime. Experts recommend allowing at least three hours between exercise and bed. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before going to sleep. Take time to unwind before going to sleep. Take a warm bath, read a book, drink some caffeine-free tea, and avoid any activities that can cause tension. Finish eating two to three hours before going to bed. Create a pleasant sleeping environment: make the room dark, cool, and comfortable. Use a sound machine, or other type of white noise device, to block out unwanted sounds. Do not watch TV or use the computer in bed. Use your bedroom for sleep and sex only. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including getting regular and quality sleep, can be a challenge, especially when you are stressed with a work deadline or test. But, remember (and you need sleep to do this! ), sleep is your friend. So, when it comes to learning and memory, sleep on it."
What are benefits of preterm formulas in supplemental feeding?,"For babies who were born early and aren't able to breast-feed, doctors often recommend a formula made specially for premature babies. These formulas are higher in calories than breast milk. They also contain: Extra protein Vitamins Minerals Special formulas."
Can my baby use formula if she's allergic to milk?,Babies who are allergic to milk proteins may need a special formula that contains broken-down versions of these proteins. There are also formulas for babies who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients from food.
Why do parents need to consider supplement options for premature babies?,"Your doctor might also recommend supplementing breast milk with formula or switching over to formula if your baby is in one of these situations: Low blood sugar Dehydrated Loses too much body weight Has a high level of jaundice Can't get enough nutrition because he's not nursing well or you aren't producing enough milk Many premature babies can tolerate breast milk. In fact, it's an ideal source of nutrition. Yet for babies who are born very small, breast milk might not be enough."
What can I take if I have bad side effects in my diabetic nephropathy medication?,"If a person has side effects from taking ACE inhibitors, another class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs) can often be given instead."
What are the symptoms of diabetic nephropathy?,"There are often no symptoms with early diabetic nephropathy. As the kidney function worsens, symptoms may include: Swelling of the hands, feet, and face Trouble sleeping or concentrating Poor appetite Nausea Weakness Itching (end-stage kidney disease) and extremely dry skin Drowsiness (end-stage kidney disease) Abnormalities in the hearts' regular rhythm, because of increased potassium in the blood Muscle twitching As kidney damage progresses, your kidneys cannot remove the waste from your blood. The waste then builds up in your body and can reach poisonous levels, a condition known as uremia. People with uremia are often confused and occasionally become comatose."
What is a hydrogen breath test?,"Raised hydrogen breath levels indicate the improper digestion of lactose, which could lead to a diagnosis of lactose intolerance or the presence of abnormal bacteria in the colon."
What happens after hydrogen breath test?,You may resume your normal activities and diet after a hydrogen breath test. A health care provider will discuss the results of the test with you.
Can you inherit chronic fatigue syndrome from your parents?,"Chronic fatigue syndrome ME/ CFS can run in families. It's possible that some people inherit a risk for it from one of their parents, such as inheriting a defect in how a particular gene is built. Probably more important than how genes are built is whether genes are turned on or off properlyâdifferences in gene activity. In people with ME/ CFS, within white blood cells and other parts of the body, there are differences in gene activity. For example, several studies have found that genes important in activating the immune system are more likely to be turned on in people with ME/ CFS."
Does age and gender affect who gets chronic fatigue syndrome?,"If you think you may have it, or are concerned that you could be at risk, check with your doctor. If you're a woman, you're four times more likely to get ME/ CFS than men. The condition is rare in children, but girls are more likely to develop it than boys. The illness most often begins in adults aged 30-50. With teenagers, those between 13 and 15 seem to have it most often."
What are your chances of survival when prostate cancer spreads?,"If it's caught and treated in this point, which is known as ""regional"" stage, your odds or recovery are very good. If it travels further, the cancer usually ends up in your bones. At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. Your doctor will talk to you about your best treatment options. What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. You may have already had surgery or radiation. Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate."
How is prostate cancer treated once it has spread to my bones?,"If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals."
How should you take care of yourself if you have prostate cancer?,"Self-care is also important: Take naps to fight fatigue and try to do some light exercise, like walking, to keep your energy levels up. Being active can also help combat weight gain, especially if you add some strength training to your routine. Check with your doctor first to make sure it's safe for you to exercise. He may suggest you work with a physical therapist."
What do studies show about exercise and depression?,"One study that involved 80 adults with mild to moderate major depression found that three sessions of heart-pumping activity each week for 12 weeks worked about as well as medication in fighting the symptoms of depression. The researchers also found that after 10 months, people who exercised were much less likely to relapse than people who took medicine. The results of another study showed that three to five weekly workouts that got the heart and lungs working harder cut mild to moderate symptoms of the mood disorder nearly in half."
What does psoriasis on your lips look like?,"Psoriasis here is rare, but it does happen. Most of the time, patches are white or gray. They can be uncomfortable and may affect the way you talk and chew."
What does psoriasis on your genitals look like?,"Psoriasis can affect your genitals. Some people only have it on their genitals. These flares are usually pink or red. They usually have little or no flaking or scaling. Psoriasis can also cause painful cracks, particularly between the buttocks."
What can you do to treat psoriasis on your lips?,"What you can do: Talk to your doctor right away. She will probably recommend a low-potency steroid cream, like 1% hydrocortisone ointment. She may suggest a steroid-free treatment like pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, which will suppress your immune system."
What are the signs of psoriasis and nail problems?,"If you have either, you might notice your nails are: Pitted, with âpockingâ or holes in the nail Thicker than normal or discolored Separated from the nail bed What you can do: You may be able to disguise mild nail changes by scraping, filing, or polishing your nails."
Is there a cure for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)?,There is no cure for CRPS.
What are the symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)?,"The symptoms of CRPS vary in their severity and length. One symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain that gets worse rather than better over time. If CRPS occurs after an injury, it may seem out of proportion to the severity of the injury. Even in cases involving an injury only to a finger or toe, pain can spread to include the entire arm or leg. In some cases, pain can even travel to the opposite extremity. Other symptoms of CRPS include: "" Burning"" pain Swelling and stiffness in affected joints Motor disability, with decreased ability to move the affected body part Changes in nail and hair growth pattern; there may be rapid hair growth or no hair growth. Skin changes; CRPS can involve changes in skin temperature -- skin on one extremity can feel warmer or cooler compared to the opposite extremity. Skin color may become blotchy, pale, purple or red. The texture of skin also can change, becoming shiny and thin. People with CRPS may have skin that sometimes is excessively sweaty. CRPS may be heightened by emotional stress."
What are the possible risks of taking part in a clinical trial for arthritis treatment?,"Potential side effects from participating in a clinical trial will depend on the type of treatment and the patient's condition. All of the risks and side effects of the treatment being researched are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. Since this is the case, there may be unknown side effects, as well as hoped-for benefits."
What are different phases of clinical trials for arthritis?,"In a phase I clinical trial, the new arthritis treatment being investigated is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely. Phase II clinical trials determine the effect of the research treatment on patients and usually the best dosage. In Phase III clinical trials, the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use."
What questions are researchers trying to answer during a clinical trial for a new arthritis treatment?,"When a new arthritis treatment is studied for the first time in humans, it is not known exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to the following questions: Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work?"
What flu-like symptoms are associated with inflammation?,"Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances."
What are treatment options for inflammatory diseases?,"The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms. The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease."

What is treatment of inflammation directed at?,"This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining and, eventually, wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones)."
What drugs are used to treat inflammatory diseases?,"The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ."

However, when ""chemotherapy"" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment."
Can inflammation affect internal organs?,Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure.
What causes normal pressure hydrocephalus?,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known."
What lab tests can help diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)?,Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms.
Why is normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) hard to diagnose?,"The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed."
How well does a shunt operation work for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)?,"The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery."
Do shunt operations work for everyone with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)?,"Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not."
Can you prevent normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)?,"There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH."
What is a hip (acetabular) labral tear?,"In others it causes pain in the groin. It can make you feel like your leg is ""catching"" or ""clicking"" in the socket as you move it. Over time, labral tears in the hip may cause permanent damage to the joint. The labrum is a band of tough cartilage and connective tissue that lines the rim of the hip socket, or acetabulum."
Who is most likely to get a labrum tear in their hip?,"Labral tears of the hip are more common in women. They also occur more often in people who have abnormalities of the hip structure, like hip dysplasia and other conditions. In recent years, experts have found that acetabular labral tears are much more common than once thought. Studies show that up to 22% of athletes who complain of groin pain have a labral tear in the hip."
What is biologic therapy for kidney cancer?,"Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses. Substances for biologic therapy are made by your body or in a lab. Examples of biologic therapy for metastatic kidney cancer include interferon alpha or interleukin-2. There are many new immunotherapies being actively studied for kidney cancer."
What are the advantages of LASIK eye surgery?,"LASIK has many benefits, including: It has been around for over 25 years and it works! It corrects vision. Around 96% of patients will have their desired vision after LASIK. An enhancement can further increase this number. LASIK is associated with very little pain due to the numbing drops that are used. Vision is corrected nearly by the day after LASIK. No bandages or stitches are required after LASIK. Adjustments can be made years after LASIK to further correct vision if vision changes while you age. After having LASIK, most patients have a dramatic reduction in eyeglass or contact lens dependence and many patients no longer need them at all."
What are the disadvantages of LASIK eye surgery?,"Despite the pluses, there are some disadvantages to LASIK eye surgery: LASIK is technically complex. Rare problems may occur when the doctor creates the flap, which can permanently affect vision. This is one reason to choose a surgeon who is very experienced at performing these surgeries. LASIK can rarely cause a loss of ""best"" vision. Your best vision is the highest degree of vision that you achieved while wearing your contacts or eyeglasses."
What is LASIK eye surgery?,"LASIK, which stands for laser in-situ keratomileusis, is a popular surgery used to correct vision in people who are nearsighted, farsighted, or have astigmatism. All laser vision correction surgeries work by reshaping the cornea, the clear front part of the eye, so that light traveling through it is properly focused onto the retina located in the back of the eye."
What happens during LASIK eye surgery?,"During LASIK eye surgery, an instrument called a microkeratome or femtosecond laser is used to create a thin flap in the cornea. The cornea flap is then painlessly peeled back and the underlying corneal tissue is reshaped using another laser. After the cornea is reshaped so that it can properly focus light onto the retina, the cornea flap is put back in place and the surgery is complete. LASIK is performed while the patient is under local anesthesia in the form of eye drops (no shots, no needles) and usually takes about 10 minutes to complete."
What are the benefits of LASIK eye surgery?,"LASIK has many benefits, including: It has been around for over 25 years and it works! It corrects vision.

After having LASIK, most patients have a dramatic reduction in eyeglass or contact lens dependence and many patients no longer need them at all."
How should I prepare on the day of my LASIK eye surgery?,"On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye makeup or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you are not feeling well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed."
Why is it important to give your child a sense of control over bedwetting to help minimize the negative emotional effects of it?,"There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope. First, work with your child to create and keep a bedwetting calendar or journal. Your child can recognize dry nights with stars and even come up with different hypotheses to test. For instance, they might decide to test whether limiting soda in the evening helps minimize bedwetting occurrences and keep track of it in their bedwetting journal. You can also encourage your child to visualize his bladder filling up overnight and imagine himself waking up to use the bathroom when he needs to urinate."
How do women with multiple sclerosis (MS) need to plan for pregnancy?,"Time it right. Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away. To limit the time you're off your medicine, try to learn your âfertility window.â That's the time of the month when you're most likely to conceive. You can buy an ovulation kit at the drugstore to help you figure it out. Your doctor can recommend other ways to help your timing, too."
Why do women with multiple sclerosis (MS) need to watch their mood?,"Women with MS have a higher risk of depression during pregnancy and especially right after they give birth. Call your doctor if you start to notice any symptoms, like feeling sad or hopeless. Your ob-gyn may also screen you for depression during a routine prenatal or postpartum visit. Your doctor can help treat your depression symptoms."
Why do women with multiple sclerosis (MS) need to build a support team before getting pregnant?,"MS can wear you out, and pregnancy can, too. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends to fix meals or help around the house so you can save your energy. Make sure your team is ready to pitch in after the baby comes, too."
How does breastfeeding affect women with multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"Think carefully about breastfeeding. If you go back on your meds, you won't be able to do it. The drugs could harm your baby through your milk. But if your doctor says it's OK to wait to take your medicine, breastfeed if you want to. It's perfectly safe for you and great for your little one. Store the milk you pump in the fridge so your partner can tackle middle-of-the night feedings. You need your rest now more than ever. Don't feel guilty if you choose medication over breastfeeding. After all, your new addition needs a mom who can stay healthy."
Should I try and time my pregnancy right if I have multiple sclerosis?,"Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away.

Should I expect some relief while I'm pregnant if I have multiple sclerosis?,"That's because pregnancy naturally protects many women from new flares, especially after the first 3 months. So enjoy it! Focus on getting the right foods, exercise, and plenty of rest."
Should I build a support team during my pregnancy if I have multiple sclerosis?,"MS can wear you out, and pregnancy can, too. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends to fix meals or help around the house so you can save your energy. Make sure your team is ready to pitch in after the baby comes, too."
Does multiple sclerosis present specific challenges to women with pregnancy?,"If you want to start a family, having multiple sclerosis ( MS) doesn't have to stop you. It doesn't keep you from getting pregnant or hurt your unborn baby. Odds are your pregnancy and delivery will be just like women without MS. Still, moms-to-be with MS face unique challenges. Plan ahead and learn what to do before, during, and after pregnancy to make your next 9 months a little easier."
Should I mind my mood if I have multiple sclerosis?,"Women with MS have a higher risk of depression during pregnancy and especially right after they give birth. Call your doctor if you start to notice any symptoms, like feeling sad or hopeless. Your ob-gyn may also screen you for depression during a routine prenatal or postpartum visit. Your doctor can help treat your depression symptoms."
Should I prop myself up if I am pregnant with multiple sclerosis?,"Prop yourself up. As you get bigger, your balance may be off. Use a cane or other walking aid so you don't fall."
Should I be aware of multiple sclerosis flare-ups after I come home from giving birth?,"In the first 9 months after birth, up to 40% of women with MS will have a relapse. But a flare doesn't raise your risk of a long-term disability. If you had many flares before pregnancy, you may be more likely to have one now. It may be a good idea to start taking your MS medicine right away to help stop one."
Why should someone with multiple sclerosis (MS) enjoy pregnancy?,"You may get a break from your MS symptoms. That's because pregnancy naturally protects many women from new flares, especially after the first 3 months. So enjoy it! Focus on getting the right foods, exercise, and plenty of rest."
How do pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS) prepare for delivery?,"Prepare for your special delivery. Chances are you'll be able to give birth just like any other woman. If you can't push because of fatigue or muscle weakness, your doctor may use special tools to help you deliver naturally. Or you might need a C-section.

What role do genes play in personal medicine for cancer?,"For years, cancer treatment was a cookie-cutter process. You'd have surgery to remove a tumor, then chemotherapy or radiation to kill cancer cells. But blasting cancers with chemotherapy or radiation kills healthy cells as well, which can lead to a host of nasty side effects. Now, researchers can examine your cancer cells and learn the order of the genes in their DNA. While most cells in your body have identical genes, the ones in cancer cells have mutations, or changes. This is what allows them to grow into tumors. What's more, your cancer may have different genetic changes than someone else's. Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. This makes the need for personalized medicine even greater."

Talk to your doctor about lubricants that may help."
Does exercise help you feel better if you have rheumatoid arthritis during menopause?,"Exercise is a simple thing that helps most women with RA feel better, including women who are going through or have been through menopause. It gives you more energy and joint flexibility, eases depression, and fights heart disease. It curbs the weight gain and insomnia that often come with menopause. Weight-bearing exercise helps protect against osteoporosis. Your doctor or a physical therapist can work with you to create a fun, safe exercise program."
Why do hormones play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Some with rheumatoid arthritis find that menopause can affect their RA. Researchers aren't sure why, but hormones seem to play a role in RA.

It can help if both of you talk together with a doctor or counselor."
When do rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms worsen?,"Estrogen levels drop around the time of menopause. When that happens, RA symptoms may worsen. Some women first get symptoms around the time they start menopause. You might think that taking estrogen would reduce RA symptoms along with the symptoms of menopause, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And because hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) is linked with heart disease -- another increased risk for women with rheumatoid arthritis - doctors rarely recommend it for treating menopause symptoms in women with RA."
Can menopause make the fatigue that comes from rheumatoid arthritis worse?,"Menopause can make the fatigue that comes with RA worse. If you don't get enough sleep at night or you think your RA treatment isn't working as well as it should be, tell your doctor."

What is macular edema?,"NPDR can cause changes in the eye including: Macular edema: Blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula and it swells. Located in the center of your retina, it's what gives you your pinpoint vision. This won't lead to blindness, but it can cause blurred vision. It can get better once you get your blood sugar and blood pressure under control. If it doesn't improve, lasers or medications injected directly into your eye may help."
What are cataracts and glaucoma?,"Cataracts, when the eye's lens clouds up, are a common cause of vision loss and a normal part of the aging process. Glaucoma, a disease that damages your optic nerve, is a leading cause of blindness for people over 60."
How often should I get a dilated eye exam if I have diabetes?,"If you have diabetes, get a dilated exam as soon as you're diagnosed. Your doctor will put drops in your eye to widen the pupil. That lets him get a better look at your retina and optic nerve. Adults with type 2 diabetes should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Your eye doctor will let you know if you need to come in more often. Let him know if you notice sudden vision changes. Blurry vision can result from blood sugar that's too high or too low."
Am I more at risk for cataracts and glaucoma if I have diabetes?,"They're not specific to diabetes, but they can show up earlier if you have it. It all depends on how well you control your blood sugar. And they're just two more reasons you need to work closely with your doctor to keep the disease under control."

What are the symptoms of stomach cancer?,"If there are symptoms, they are typically vague. These can include: Indigestion and stomach discomfort A bloated feeling after eating Mild nausea Loss of appetite Heartburn Peptic ulcers and acid reflux (also called GERD) cause similar symptoms. Antacids or histamine blockers may give temporary relief. Many other conditions can cause these symptoms as well.

Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary."
Is medical marijuana regulated?,"Another issue is that the FDA doesn't oversee medical marijuana like it does prescription drugs.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the ""high"" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it."
Why has so little research been done about medical marijuana?,"One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug. The agency did, however, agree to support additional research on marijuana and make the process easier for researchers."""

How is juvenile osteoporosis diagnosed?,"The signs and symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis include: Pain in the lower back, hips, knees, ankles, and feet Trouble with walking Fractures in the legs, ankles, or feet Juvenile osteoporosis is hard to define. Bone density scans are the most accurate way to detect lowered bone mass early on, but they need to be interpreted carefully to make a clear diagnosis in children. Instead, doctors usually diagnose juvenile when there are signs that a child has a fragile skeleton. This might show up when a child's bone breaks without something like a bad fall or other trauma, and the child has a low bone mineral density score."
What is idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis?,"Idiopathic osteoporosis means that doctors don't know what caused the disease. This type of juvenile osteoporosis is much less common. It seems to be more common in boys than in girls. It usually starts just before puberty. The child's bone density may mostly recover during puberty, but still not quite be normal when bone mass peaks as an adult."
How do I take care of a child affected by juvenile osteoporosis?,"It's very important to protect your child's bones from fracture. He may need to use crutches or other supports. He may also need to avoid types of exercise, such as contact sports, that could cause a fracture. Your doctor can tell you what's OK. All children, including those with juvenile osteoporosis, need a lifestyle that helps build healthy bones. This includes a diet rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, and as much safe physical activity as possible. It's best to avoid caffeine. Many experts also suggest that children with juvenile osteoporosis get bone density tests at least every other year into adulthood."

When should someone seek medical attention for peritonitis?,"If you have any symptoms of peritonitis, call your doctor right away. Seeking prompt medical attention is especially important for peritoneal dialysis patients who have a combination of abdominal pain and a clouding of the peritoneal fluid, which is caused by a buildup of infection-fighting white blood cells. Because peritonitis can rapidly lead to potentially fatal complications such as sepsis and septic shock, which causes a massive drop in blood pressure, organ failure, and death, it's essential to receive a quick diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment."
What should you know about peritonitis?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum, the tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers and supports most of your abdominal organs. Peritonitis is usually caused by infection from bacteria or fungi. Left untreated, peritonitis can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) and to other organs, resulting in multiple organ failure and death. So if you develop any of the symptoms of peritonitis -- the most common of which is severe abdominal pain -- it's essential to seek prompt medical evaluation and treatment that can prevent potentially fatal complications."

Should I consider surgery for ulcerative colitis flares?,"It's not an immediate fix, and not everyone needs an operation to keep UC in check. But for some people, it can help. Your doctor might suggest surgery if you've had the condition for a long time, or if your flares are so severe that drugs no longer control them. An operation might help prevent colon cancer, which people with UC are more likely to get."
Should I self-medicate for ulcerative colitis flares?,"Unless your doctor has OK'd it ahead of time, don't pick and choose your own treatment. Something you have in your medicine cabinet from a previous flare might have helped you in the past. But have those meds expired? And are they right for you this time? Check with your doctor first."
What are the procedures for ulcerative colitis surgery?,"There are two different types of procedures. Both surgeries remove the colon and rectum.

Blood clots can also form if your veins are damaged during an operation. Surgeries that involve scraping or cutting into a bone, such as a hip replacement, may release substances known as antigens. These antigens trigger your body's immune system and can lead to clots."
When are you more likely to get a blood clot?,"While a clot can form after any type of procedure, you're more likely to get one if you've had major surgery, particularly on your abdomen, pelvis, hips, or legs."
How can blood clots be prevented?,"Let your doctor know right away if you have any signs of DVT or PE: Pain or tenderness in your leg Swelling or warmth in your leg Red or discolored skin on your leg Veins that stick out Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Sudden chest pain Painful breathing Before your surgery, stop smoking. Work on getting rid of any extra pounds you're carrying. Talk to your doctor if you need help. After your surgery, you'll want you to keep your blood moving. Your doctor may prescribe blood thinner medicines, which are also called anticoagulants. They make it harder for your blood to stick together and form clots. Simple movements, such as leg lifts while you're in bed, can improve blood flow. You might need to take pain medicine so you can exercise comfortably. Elastic compression stockings or a compression device can help stop blood from pooling in your veins."
What are the signs and symptoms of blood clots?,"Only about half of people who get DVT have symptoms. Let your doctor know right away if you have any signs of DVT or PE: Pain or tenderness in your leg Swelling or warmth in your leg Red or discolored skin on your leg Veins that stick out Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Sudden chest pain Painful breathing Before your surgery, stop smoking."
How can blood clots happen?,"Surgery is one of the major causes of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT), a blood clot that forms in the deep veins of your body, often in your leg. Clots happen when blood thickens and sticks together. That can be a good thing when it prevents you from bleeding, but not so much when a clot forms inside your blood vessels. Sometimes, one can travel to your lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism ( PE), and it can be life-threatening if it blocks blood flow."
What triggers tinnitus?,"Triggers may include: Age-related hearing loss Loud noises like concerts, sporting events, machinery, or backfiring engines Sinus pressure from sinus or ear infections, cold, flu, or allergies Too much earwax Certain medications like aspirin, some antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Migraines and other headaches High blood pressure and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Jaw problems Other medical issues like head and neck injuries, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, changes in your inner ear bones, and an inner ear disorder called Meniere's disease."
What are other treatment options for tinnitus?,"Other treatment options may include: Hearing aids. These devices can help with age-related hearing loss and tinnitus. They make the sounds you need to hear louder and make the ringing harder to notice. Sound maskers. You wear them in or behind your ear to create constant low-level white noise. This helps block the ringing. You might also try a white noise machine near your bed at night to help you sleep. Retraining therapy. You get counseling and wear a gadget that masks the ringing with tonal music. Relaxation techniques. Tinnitus can get worse when you're stressed. You might find ways to ease your worries, like exercise, deep breathing, or biofeedback. Medicines. There are several medications that show some promise in treating tinnitus, including certain hormones, topical anesthetics, and anti-anxiety medication. Ask your doctor if any of them may be right for you."
Is there a treatment for tinnitus?,"It depends on what's to blame for the ringing. If a medication is the trigger, your doctor might suggest you stop taking it or change to a different drug. Never stop a medicine on your own without talking to your doctor first. If a health issue like high blood pressure is the cause, your doctor can work with you to treat it. Often the ringing will improve when you get the condition under control. If the problem is too much earwax, the doctor can remove the buildup gently. Don't use cotton swabs to try to do it yourself."
How is tinnitus diagnosed?,"Your doctor will discuss your medical history. He'll ask about any medicines you take, including supplements. He'll do a hearing test, examine your head and neck, and look inside your ears. He might ask you to clench your jaw, move your eyes, and move your neck, arms, and legs. If the ringing gets worse when you move, that may help find a cause for it. You may also need imaging tests like CT or MRI scans."
What does a fibroadenoma feel like?,"Usually, a fibroadenoma won't cause any pain. It will feel like a marble that moves around beneath your skin. You may describe the texture as firm, smooth, or rubbery. In some cases, though, you won't even be able to feel it at all."
How is a fibroadenoma treated if it gets larger?,"If your fibroadenoma gets larger, the doctor suspects that it might, or he isn't sure whether a lump is a fibroadenoma or not, he'll likely recommend removing any lumps. This will help confirm that a lump isn't cancer and that it doesn't grow and distort the surrounding breast tissue."
What does follow-up care for fibroadenoma entail?,"Most women won't need anything beyond routine screening tests. They'll continue to get any breast changes checked out by a doctor. Having a simple fibroadenoma may raise your risk of breast cancer, compared with women without fibroadenomas. But if yours was complex, it might mean a slightly higher risk of breast cancer later on. Unless you have other things that make breast cancer more likely, like close family members with the disease, your odds are still low. Either way, keep up with your regular checkups, and ask your doctor which screening tests you need and when."
Who gets fibroadenomas?,"Fibroadenomas are very common. About 10% of women have one of these breast lumps, often without ever knowing. They most often appear in women between the ages of 15 and 35, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Some researchers have found that women with a family history of breast cancer are more likely to get fibroadenomas. Most women only have one."
How are fibroadenomas treated if they have been removed in the past?,"If you've had more than one fibroadenoma removed in the past, and tests confirmed that that's what they were, your doctor also may delay removing any new lumps."
What is the recommended daily allowance for vitamin E?,Recommended daily allowance: 22.5 international units/day.
What is the safe upper limit for vitamin E?,"Safe upper limit: 1,500 IU Potential risks: Vitamin E can thin your blood, and may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke."
How long does an exercise stress test last?,Foods with vitamin E: Cereal with wheat germ 27 IU Almonds (1 oz) 11 IU Sunflower seeds (1 oz) 11 IU Hazelnuts (1 oz) 6.4 IU Peanut butter (1 tablespoon) 4 IU Peanuts (1 oz) 3.6 IU
What are potential risks of taking vitamin E?,"Safe upper limit: 1,500 IU Potential risks: Vitamin E can thin your blood, and may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. If you're taking a blood-thinning medication, talk to your doctor before taking a vitamin E supplement. One recent study showed increased mortality in people taking more than 2,000 international units of vitamin E. Other possible side effects cited in studies include fatigue, muscle weakness, and decreased thyroid gland function."
What role does the brain play in motion sickness?,"Your brain takes in all this data, and it usually comes together and makes sense. But sometimes your brain gets confusing signals. On a flying plane, for example, you feel like you're moving, but your eyes tell your brain that you don't appear to be going anywhere. The opposite is true as well. After a long sea voyage, you can stand still on dry land but still feel like you're moving. The result is the same: motion sickness."
What causes motion sickness?,"You get motion sickness when there are conflicts among your senses. Say you're on a ride at the fair, and it's spinning you around and upside down. Your eyes see one thing, your muscles feel another, and your inner ears sense something else. Your brain can't take in all those mixed signals. That's why you end up feeling dizzy and sick."
What medications are available for motion sickness?,"If you're still bothered by motion sickness, you can talk to your doctor about these: Dimenhydrinate ( Dramamine). This over-the-counter antihistamine, used to ease allergies, helps with balance, too. The first dose should be taken about an hour before traveling. More doses are taken every 4 to 6 hours. Scopolamine ( Maldemar). This is a prescription medication. Your wear a patch behind the ear. You apply it 4 hours before needed. A dose lasts 3 days. Other drugs include: Cyclizine ( Marezine, Marzine, Emoquil) Meclizine ( Antivert, Bonine) Promethazine ( Phenadoz, Phenergan, Promethegan) All have side effects, including drowsiness and dry mouth."
What role do the ears play in motion sickness?,"Your inner ears, in particular, help control your sense of balance. They are part of a network called the vestibular system. This system includes three pairs of semicircular canals and two sacs, called the saccule and the utricle. They send information about what's going on around you to the brain. The semicircular canals hold a fluid that moves with the turns of your head. The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. They tell the brain whether you're standing up or lying down."
What if my motion sickness doesn't go away on its own?,"But there are some simple things you can do if the motion sickness isn't going away on its own: Relax. Find something to focus on, whether it's taking deep breaths or counting backwards from 100. Closing your eyes can help, too. Look at a stable object. If you're on a boat, look at the horizon. If you're in a car, look through the windshield. Avoid alcohol. Eat lightly before travel but don't fast. Breathe fresh air -- and don't smoke. Avoid reading. If you can, get a seat over the wing if you're flying, an upper-deck cabin if you're sailing, or a front-seat spot if you're in a car."
Can I go to the doctor for motion sickness?,"Motion sickness usually goes away once the journey is over. But if you're still dizzy, have a headache, continue to vomit, notice hearing loss or chest pain, call your doctor."
"If I have to take my baby outdoors, how can I protect him?","Cover with clothes. Dress your baby so bugs don't have any access to skin. Loose-fitting long sleeves and pants Socks A hat Skip the bright, flowery prints. Bugs are attracted to those. Protect with a net. Use a fitted mesh net over carriers and strollers when you take your baby outdoors."
Should I get rid of standing water to protect my baby from bug bites?,"Look around your house for soggy sites, like: Planters Birdbaths Wading pools Drill holes in tire swings to keep water from collecting. Change your pets' water bowls regularly."
"Once my baby is over 2 months old, can I use bug repellents?","Once your baby is a little older, you can add repellent sprays and lotions to your bug-fighting kit. According to the CDC, insect repellent is the best way to protect your baby from mosquito bites -- as long as you use it correctly. Repellents also protect from other biting bugs like ticks, fleas, chiggers, and biting flies. But they don't work for stinging bugs, like wasps, bees, and hornets."
Can avoiding bug hangout spots help protect your baby from bug bites?,"Flower gardens, garbage cans, piles of dead leaves, and bushes are all popular places for bug parties, so steer clear."
Can you use bug repellents on a baby under 2 months?,"The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) is clear: Bug repellents -- even the DEET-free ones -- are not safe for newborns. Since you can't use lotions and sprays on the very small, the best way to keep your baby from becoming a bug buffet is by avoiding bugs in the first place. Stay in. Bugs, especially mosquitoes, are most active at dawn and dusk. Keep your baby indoors during those hours to lower his bite risk. Defend your house. Make sure your windows and doors have screens to keep bugs from flying or crawling inside."
What bug repellents work the best?,"Research says repellents with these active ingredients work the longest: DEET I5353 Picaridin When you use DEET, choose products with less than 30%."
Can I put both bug repellent and sunscreen on my baby?,"If you want to put sunscreen on your baby, too, do that first. Don't use a bug repellent and sunscreen combo. You'll have to reapply it more often than repellent alone."
How much DEET do I need to protect my baby from bug bites?,"Research says repellents with these active ingredients work the longest: DEET I5353 Picaridin When you use DEET, choose products with less than 30%. And the less time your baby will be outside, the lower the concentration of DEET you should use."
How can you recognize mania in bipolar disorder?,"If you have bipolar disorder and are having a manic episode, you might be very energetic, get very little sleep because you're so wired, and find yourself talking faster because your thoughts are racing. You might feel like the world's best multitasker. You might also take risks that you normally wouldn't take. Examples could include going on a spending spree or driving recklessly. Sometimes this kind of behavior is easy to spot, but not always. That's especially true if you have a milder form of a high, called hypomania. You might feel good, be happy that you're extra energetic, and think that you're just being productive. Friends and family members may be better able to notice that you're acting out of character."
How is herpes spread?,"HSV-1, which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin, can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils. In general, a person can only get HSV-2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread even if sores are not present. Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth."
What are symptoms of herpes?,"For many people with herpes, attacks (outbreaks) of herpes can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity, medical treatments or sunburn Menstruation Symptoms of HSV typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum. The blisters break, leaving tender sores."
What conditions causes outbreaks of herpes?,"For many people with herpes, attacks (outbreaks) of herpes can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity, medical treatments or sunburn Menstruation Symptoms of HSV typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum."
How is herpes diagnosed?,"Often, the appearance of HSV is typical and no testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If a health care provider is uncertain, HSV can be diagnosed with laboratory tests, including DNA -- or PCR -- tests and virus cultures."
How can transcranial magnetic stimulation help prevent migraines?,"There are also several devices which can prevent migraines: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS): During this treatment, you'll hold a small device called Spring TMS to the back of your head. It sends a split-second pulse which interrupts abnormal electrical activity caused by migraine, thus aborts the migraine. Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation ( TSNS): Cefaly uses transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation and is worn as a headband on the forehead and turned on daily for 20 minutes to prevent migraine from developing. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (n VS): gamma Core is a n VS and works by being placed placed over the vagus nerve in the neck. It releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."
How can biofeedback help prevent migraines?,"You can try: Biofeedback: This type of therapy teaches you to be aware of how your body reacts to stress, whether that's tense muscles, a fast heart rate, or cold, clammy hands. A trained professional teaches you how to change that response and calm down. Studies show that people who use biofeedback have 55% fewer migraines. This therapy may work even better when you also take medicine that prevents headaches."
How can progressive muscle relaxation help prevent migraines?,"Progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR): This relaxation technique helps stop your body's response to stress before it triggers a migraine. A therapist will show you to tightly contract, then fully release, each of your muscles. He'll also teach you to deepen and slow your breathing."
How can tonabersat help prevent migraines?,They affect the release of certain brain chemicals and block pain pathways in your brain.
How can cognitive behavioral therapy help to prevent migraines?,She'll also teach you to change the way your body reacts to the pain you feel during an attack.
How do triggers of migraines vary?,"Every person with migraine has different symptoms. Everyone's triggers are different too, although some common ones include lack of sleep, certain foods, and stress. As doctors learn more about migraine and what parts of the brain are involved, they're finding better ways to prevent these headaches."
How should you adjust your treatment for rheumatoid arthritis if you are family planning?,"As soon as you're considering starting a family, see your rheumatologist. Some drugs need a months-long ""washout"" period before trying to conceive. And that goes for men as well as women; although unproven, methotrexate might result in sperm problems that could cause birth defects. If you're taking leflunomide for RA, even more advance planning is necessary. Due to its long half-life, leflunomide needs to be stopped two years before trying to conceive a baby, although there are ways to ""wash"" it out of your system quicker."
What is the future of rheumatoid arthritis treatment?,"New biologic drugs for RA have created a new era of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, according to rheumatologists. With early and aggressive treatment, most people with RA can avoid joint deformities and major disability."
Does rheumatoid arthritis affect your fertility?,"Experts disagree whether rheumatoid arthritis reduces fertility in women or men. It's true that many women with RA take longer to conceive than women without rheumatoid arthritis. Inconsistent ovulation, decreased sex drive, or having sex less often due to pain and fatigue are possible explanations. For men, acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis temporarily reduce sperm count and function, and can cause erection problems and decreased libido. For both men and women, effective treatment for RA improves sexual symptoms and function. In well-treated rheumatoid arthritis, fertility in most men and women is probably normal."
How can your doctor help with family planning if you have rheumatoid arthritis?,"Your rheumatologist will help you decide on a treatment plan that includes both control of your RA symptoms and safety for your baby. Low-dose prednisone, forexample, is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine are also considered safe. While evidence is limited for biologic medicines like etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi), infliximab ( Remicade), and infliximab-abda ( Renflexis) or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), biosimilars, many rheumatologists are confident in their relative safety during pregnancy. One way to avoid the risk of pregnancy problems from RA medications is to simply not take any. Under a doctor's supervision, some women quit RA drugs ""cold turkey"" when they begin trying to conceive. This method has its own risk, of course: possible progression of joint damage from flares during the time when you are off treatment. In certain women, though, some rheumatologists endorse the approach, with close monitoring for disease activity."
Can rheumatoid arthritis hurt your baby?,"Rheumatoid arthritis itself doesn't seem to harm the developing baby, even if RA is active during pregnancy. In fact, 70% to 80% of women with RA have improvement of their symptoms during pregnancy. Although some women with RA may have a slight risk of miscarriage or low-birth-weight babies, the vast majority of women have normal pregnancies without complications. However, many drugs for rheumatoid arthritis -- including methotrexate ( Otrexup, Rheumatrex, Trexall) and leflunomide ( Arava) -- can cause birth defects. These same medications may also cause birth defects if they are taken by men who father children. Therefore, it's important to talk to your doctor about altering treatment several months before you or your spouse try to get pregnant."
What can you do to feel better from menstrual triggers of irritable bowel syndrome?,"How to Feel Better: Think about taking birth control pills. They can make your periods more regular. But they can cause side effects, like upset stomach, vomiting, stomach cramps or bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Work with your doctor to find one that works without causing other problems.

Worries can come from a lot of sources, including: Work Your commute Problems at home Money problems A sense that things are out of your control How to Manage Stress: Choose healthy habits."
What are better meds to avoid irritable bowel syndrome?,"People with IBS may have trouble with: Antibiotics Some antidepressants Medicine made with sorbitol, such as cough syrup How to Choose Better Meds: Talk with your doctor about switching to a drug that won't make your symptoms flare. But ask her before you stop taking your meds. Choose antidepressants wisely. Older ones, called tricyclic antidepressants, can cause constipation. Standard ones, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like fluoxetine ( Prozac, Sarafem) and sertraline ( Zoloft), can cause diarrhea. Work with your doctor to find the right one."
What are better diet choices to avoid irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea?,"Better Diet Choices for Diarrhea: Eat a moderate amount of soluble fiber. It adds bulk to your stools. Good sources are whole wheat breads, oats, barley, brown rice, whole-grain pasta, the flesh of fruit (not the skin), and dried fruits. Don't eat foods at opposite temperatures, such as ice-cold water and steaming hot soup, in the same meal. Stay away from broccoli, onions, and cabbage. They cause gas, which can make you feel worse. Eat smaller portions. Drink water an hour before or after meals, not while you eat. Talk with your doctor or a dietitian if you think you may have a wheat allergy.

People also take glutathione to try to treat weakened immune systems or infertility, as well as many other conditions. In a small study (40 subjects), glutathione administered intravenously was found to improve pain-free walking distance. In fact, taking glutathione by mouth does not appear to be an effective way to get it into your body.

What helps people with nystagmus see?,"More lighting may help with vision, too. If your child has nystagmus, encourage her to use her eyes. Big and brightly colored toys are easiest to use. Choose toys that make noise and have unique textures. Let your child hold books close to her eyes with her head tilted. Let her wear a hat or tinted glasses -- even indoors -- to reduce glare. Talk to your child's teacher to make things easier at school."
How is nystagmus diagnosed?,"You might get other tests, including: Ear exam Neurological exam Brain MRI Brain CT scan Recording your eye movement Your doctor may ask you to spin around in the chair for about 30 seconds, stop, and then try to stare at an object. If you have nystagmus, your eyes will first move slowly in one direction. Then they'll move quickly the other way."

Conversely, because of its estrogenic effects, raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots, including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) and pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung). Studies show that the risk of blood clots over a five year period is less than 1% for women who did not have a history of blood clots. Patients taking raloxifene should avoid tobacco use and prolonged periods of immobility during travel, when blood clots are more prone to occur."

Because fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose -- typically, health care providers rule out other conditions through a physical exam and various blood tests -- it's important that you do your homework before you apply for disability. According to federal regulations, to qualify for disability you must prove that you have a severe impairment. You also need to prove that the impairment limits your physical or mental ability to do work. The Social Security disability regulations define disability as ""the inability to do any substantial gainful activity due to your medical or mental problem."" In addition, according to the Social Security Administration, your condition must interfere with basic work-related activities. If it doesn't, your claim won't be considered. Instead, Social Security will find that you are not disabled. The combined effect of having multiple impairments is taken into account. That can be important for many people with fibromyalgia. You must be unable to do your previous work or any other substantial gainful activity. Your age and education are considered, as well as your remaining abilities and your work experience."

Can you get flaxseed naturally from foods?,"While no other food sources contain flaxseed, flaxseed is itself sometimes added to foods. Ground flaxseed is sold as flour. Flaxseed oil might be added to salad dressing, but it should not be used for cooking."
Why do people take flaxseed?,"Flaxseed and flaxseed oil contain alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA), one of the essential omega-3 fatty acids that partly and inefficiently converts into DHA and EPA -- more active omega-3s -- in the body. While flaxseed hasn't yet been shown to improve heart disease risk, there's good evidence that flaxseed and flaxseed oil may lower cholesterol levels. Ground flaxseed -- but not flaxseed oil -- may also help with menopausal symptoms. One study showed that 40 grams per day may be similar to hormone therapy for improving mild menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. But other studies contradict this finding. Ground flaxseed may also ease constipation. Flaxseed has also been shown to improve kidney function in people with lupus. If you have lupus -- or any other medical condition -- it's very important to talk with your doctor about any supplements you take."
What are the risks of taking flaxseed?,"Never eat raw or unripe flaxseed -- it could be poisonous. People who have diabetes, bipolar disorder, high triglycerides, bleeding disorders, or prostate cancer should talk to a doctor before using flaxseed or flaxseed oil. Anyone with digestive problems (like Crohn's disease, IBS, or colitis) and women with hormone-sensitive diseases (like endometriosis, PCOS, breast cancer, and uterine cancer) should not use flaxseed. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, flaxseed and flaxseed oil is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
What are the side effects of taking flaxseed?,"At normal doses, flaxseed and flaxseed oil seem to be safe. Flaxseed -- and not flaxseed oil -- contains soluble fiber. It might cause diarrhea, cramping, gas, and bloating. High doses of flaxseed, especially when not taken with enough water, can cause constipation and, rarely, bowel obstruction. If ground flaxseed or flaxseed oil oxidizes (goes rancid), it may cause cholesterol problems and inflammation."
What helps you pay attention in conversations if you have ADHD?,"Simple steps can make any conversation easier. Make sure you: Are face-to-face with the other person when you're talking to them Listen carefully when they're speaking Don't interrupt Ask questions when you don't understand something Let the other person know you understand them by using phrases like â It sounds like you're saying,â or â Tell me if I'm hearing you right ...â You might feel like the people closest to you are constantly criticizing or nagging you."

Or you may notice pain, redness, a stringy discharge, or blurred vision. Some people find they can't cry even when they're upset."
Can immune system problems lead to infections?,"Other red flags: Chronic sinus infections, being sick with more than four ear infections in a year (for anyone over the age of 4), or having pneumonia more than once."
Can immune system problems cause tingling or numbness in your hands and feet?,"It can be completely innocent. But in some cases it can mean that your body is attacking nerves that send signals to your muscles. People who have Guillain- Barre syndrome, for instance, may have numbness that starts in their legs then moves up to their arms and chest. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( CIDP) has symptoms similar to the demyelinating form of GBS (called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or AIDP), but while GBS lasts two weeks to 30 days."

Can immune system problems cause swallowing issues?,"If you have a tough time getting food down, your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach) could be swollen or too weak to work well. Some people feel like food is stuck in their throat or chest. Others gag or choke when they swallow. One of the possible causes can be a problem with your immune system."
Can immune system problems cause bathroom problems?,"Diarrhea that lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks can be a warning sign that your immune system is harming the lining of your small intestine or digestive tract. Constipation is a concern, too. If your bowel movements are hard to pass, very firm, or look like they're made up of small rabbit pellets, your immune system may be forcing your intestine to slow down. Other possible causes include bacteria, viruses, and other health conditions."

If you now have a waist measurement of more than 35 inches, it's time to take steps to reverse this trend."
What is the impact of estrogen on weight gain and menopause?,"With lower estrogen levels, lab animals tend to eat more and be less physically active. Reduced estrogen may also lower metabolic rate, the rate at which the body converts stored energy into working energy. It's possible the same thing happens with women when estrogen levels drop after menopause. Some evidence suggests that estrogen hormone therapy increases a woman's resting metabolic rate. This might help slow weight gain. Lack of estrogen may also cause the body to use starches and blood sugar less effectively, which would increase fat storage and make it harder to lose weight."
"What are other benefits of exercise, besides helping with weight gain after menopause?","Exercise has many other perks aside from weight loss, including: Lower risk of osteoporosis Lower risks of metabolic syndrome, heart attack, and other cardiovascular diseases Improved insulin resistance Keeps joints and muscles strong Helps bowels work well Relieves depression and anxiety Improves overall health What types of exercise can best help you lose and maintain weight after menopause?"

What is the current solution for antibiotic resistance?,"In 2015, the White House created a National Action Plan for Combatting Antibiotic Resistance. Its recommendations include: Scientists should step up the development of new antibiotics and vaccines as well as diagnostic tests to identify drug-resistant bacteria. Public health officials should monitor antibiotic resistance and track its spread. Doctors should help stop unnecessary antibiotic use and develop safer practices in hospitals and clinics. Farmers should stop giving animals antibiotics needed to treat diseases in people."
How do bacteria become antibiotic resistant?,"Some bacteria can naturally resist certain kinds of antibiotics. Others can become resistant if their genes change or they get drug-resistant genes from other bacteria. The longer and more often antibiotics are used, the less effective they are against those bacteria."

What is bulimia nervosa like?,"People with bulimia nervosa have episodes of eating large amounts of food (called bingeing) followed by purging (vomiting or using laxatives), fasting, or exercising excessively to compensate for the overeating. Unlike anorexia, people with bulimia are often a normal weight. But they have the same intense fear of gaining weight and distorted body image. They see themselves as âfatâ and desperately want to lose weight. Because they often feel ashamed and disgusted with themselves, people with bulimia become very good at hiding the bulimic behaviors."

How do eating disorders develop?,"Eating disorders tend to develop during the teenage and young adult years, and they are much more common in girls and women. No one knows the precise cause of eating disorders, but they seem to coexist with psychological and medical issues such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, trouble coping with emotions, and substance abuse. For some people, a preoccupation with food becomes a way to gain control over one aspect of their lives. Although it may start out as simply eating a bit more or less than usual, the behavior can spiral out of control and take over the person's life. Eating disorders are a serious medical problem that can have long-term health consequences if left untreated."
What can happen if anorexia is left untreated?,"Refusal to eat certain foods, such as carbs or fats Avoiding mealtimes or eating in front of others Preparing elaborate meals for others but refusing to eat them Exercising excessively Making comments about being âfatâ Stopping menstruating Complaining about constipation or stomach pain Denying that extreme thinness is a problem Because people with anorexia are so good at hiding it, the disease may become severe before anyone around them notices anything wrong. If you think someone you care about has anorexia, it's important to have them evaluated by a doctor right away. If left untreated, anorexia can lead to serious complications such as malnutrition and organ failure. However, with treatment, most people with anorexia will gain back the weight they lost, and the physical problems they developed as a result of the anorexia will get better."

These individuals anticipate disaster and ruminate about their health, their finances, their work, their relationships and family problems."
What are the symptoms of panic disorder?,"Panic disorder involves the sudden onset of overwhelming fear and terror. The person may also experience: Chest pain Choking Difficulty breathing Dizziness Gastrointestinal distress Headache Shortness of breath Sweaty palms Tachycardia (an unusually rapid heart beat) Trembling The person feels like he or she is either going to faint, have a heart attack and die, or go crazy."
How is substance use disorder treated if you also have depression?,"Taking more of the substance to ease withdrawal symptoms Withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, shaking, insomnia, agitation, hallucination, and sweating following a reduction in the amount of a substance taken There are varied approaches to treating people with substance abuse plus depression. Some will need detoxification in a hospital or a clinic. Rehabilitation may include one-on-one counseling, group counseling, and support groups. Antidepressant medicines -- in combination with education to help people address and conquer the emotions that cause them to abuse drugs or alcohol -- can also be effective."
How are implants used for breast reconstruction?,"Implants involve stretching the skin with a tissue expander that goes inside you, and then inserting a silicone-gel or saline (salt water) implant weeks later. The tissue expander is filled to a desired volume by adding saline, usually once a week for a few sessions. Many women find these sessions painful, but they're often pleased with the final result. Implants can rupture, causing pain and infection. You may need surgery to remove or replace them."
When is the best time to have a breast reconstruction?,"The timing is based on your desires, medical conditions, and cancer treatment. You can choose to have it done during the same operation to remove the breast, or months or years after a mastectomy. If you've started any chemotherapy or radiation treatments, reconstruction is usually postponed until you complete those treatments. Your surgeon can help you decide the right timing for you."

Your doctor might do an ultrasound scan of your neck called a carotid intima-media thickness test to check them out."
Why would my doctor check my thyroid gland while I am taking statins?,"If it's not making enough hormones, a condition called hypothyroidism, it may cause muscle pain when you take statins."
Could I be allergic to echinacea if I am allergic to other plants?,"If this happens, you might get: Rashes Worsening of asthma symptoms Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening emergency that can cause trouble breathing) You might be at higher risk of having a reaction to echinacea if you're allergic to other plants in the daisy family. This includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, and marigolds."
What is echinacea?,"It's a flowering plant that grows in the U. S. and Canada, and it's been used as medicine for centuries. There are nine species. Some of its common names are the purple coneflower or black-eyed Susan. The leaves, stems, flower, and roots are used to make supplements, liquid extracts, and teas."
How long should you take echinacea?,"Some experts say you shouldn't take echinacea for more than 8 weeks at a time. Although there is no evidence that the herb would cause harm after this point, doctors don't know enough yet about its long-term safety."
What are possible reasons for conflicting results of studies on echinacea?,"Still, sometimes it's hard to compare the results of different studies, because they look at different types and strengths of echinacea, as well as different parts of the plant or root. It's possible that some versions are better than others. Also, it's possible the herbal remedy may be useful against some, but not all, of the more than 200 viruses that cause colds."
Is echinacea regulated in the United States?,"Keep in mind that herbal remedies like echinacea aren't regulated in the U. S. the way medications are. The makers of supplements don't have to show their products are safe or effective before they go on the market. Also, there's a chance that what you buy at the drugstore may not actually have what the label says it does."
Can my doctor give me information about herbal cold remedies?,"If you're interested in using echinacea or another alternative treatment, talk to your doctor. Remember, herbal remedies may have risks, just like any drug. They can cause side effects and could affect how other medications work."
How do you care for bonded teeth?,"Bonded teeth do not require special care. Simply follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush teeth at least twice a day, floss at least once a day, rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash once or twice a day, and see your dentist for regular professional check-ups and cleanings. Because bonding material can chip, it is important to avoid such habits as biting fingernails; chewing on pens, ice, or other hard food objects; or using your bonded teeth as an opener."
How long does bonding material last?,"The lifespan of bonding materials for the teeth depends on how much bonding was done and your oral habits. Typically, however, bonding material lasts from three years up to about 10 years before needing to be touched up or replaced."
When do you get dental bonding?,Dental bonding is an option that can be considered: To repair decayed teeth (composite resins are used to fill cavities) To repair chipped or cracked teeth To improve the appearance of discolored teeth To close spaces between teeth To make teeth look longer To change the shape of teeth As a cosmetic alternative to amalgam fillings To protect a portion of the tooth's root that has been exposed when gums recede Preparation.
What is chest discomfort or pressure like as a symptom of a heart attack in men?,"The pain can be severe, but it doesn't have to be. It can be a feeling of âfullness,â squeezing, or pressure. It can even be mistaken for heartburn. The discomfort often happens in the left or center of your chest. The feeling may last for more than several minutes, or it may come and go."
What is chest pain like as a symptom of a heart attack in men?,"This is the most common symptom of a heart attack in both men and women. Most often, it starts slowly with mild pain or discomfort. A sudden onset of severe symptoms is sometimes called a â Hollywood heart attack,â because of the typical way heart attacks have been portrayed in movies and television. A heart attack can happen this way, but it doesn't that often."
What is pain like as a symptom of a heart attack in men?,"Pain or discomfort sometimes shows up in other areas because they're not getting enough blood. Usually, it's an area of the body that's above the waist, including the upper part of your stomach, your shoulders, one arm (probably the left) or both, your back, neck or jaw, even your teeth."
When should you get help because of symptoms of a heart attack?,"Another possible sign is breaking into a cold sweat The more symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack."
What are other symptoms of a heart attack in men?,"Shortness of breath, called dyspnea, can happen with or without chest pain and may even be your only symptom. It can happen when you're being active or not and is probably due to congestion (fluid buildup) in your lungs. You may also find yourself coughing or wheezing. Feeling tired for no reason is another common sign. You might feel anxious, too. Nausea and vomiting are less common in men than women. Some people say they feel light-headed or dizzy. Another possible sign is breaking into a cold sweat The more symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack. But bear in mind, you may have no symptoms at all. These are called silent heart attacks and are more common the older you are or if you have diabetes."
What are the symptoms of lipedema?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The typical symptoms are a large lower half and column-like legs, which are often tender and bruise easily. For example, the top half of your body may be a size 8, but the bottom half may be a size 16."
How does lipedema develop?,"As the condition progresses, fat continues to build up, and your lower body grows heavier. The lipedemic fat can later collect in the arms. Over time, fat cells block the vessels of your lymphatic system, which normally helps balance body fluid levels and protect against infection. This blockage prevents the proper drainage of lymph fluid, leading to a buildup of fluid called lymphedema."
What can happen if lipedema is untreated?,"Unlike obesity, it targets legs, thighs and sometimes arms. Unlike lymphedema, lipedema doesn't start in the lower legs (feet and ankles) but the upper legs, and it isn't related to prior surgery. It usually affects both legs."
What causes lipedema?,"The cause is not known, but doctors suspect female hormones play a role. That's because the condition affects mostly women, and it often begins or worsens at puberty, during pregnancy, following gynecologic surgery, and around the time of menopause. Scientists also believe genes are involved, because many women with the condition have family members with the condition."
Can diet and exercise help with lipedema?,The lipedemic fat can later collect in the arms.
How are lentigines treated?,"There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing it off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat."
How are moles treated?,"If a dermatologist believes a mole needs to be evaluated further, he or she will do a biopsy by shaving or cutting out the entire spot so that it can be evaluated under the microscope. This is a simple procedure. ( If the dermatologist thinks the mole might be cancerous, cutting through the mole will not cause the cancer to spread.) If the mole is found to be cancerous, the dermatologist will cut out the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area and a rim of normal skin around it, and stitching the wound closed."
What are the ABCDEs of examining moles?,"The following ABCDEs are important characteristics to consider when examining moles. If a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked immediately by a dermatologist. It could be cancerous. Asymmetry. One half of the mole does not match the other half. Border. The border or edges of the mole are ragged, blurred, or irregular. Color. The color of the mole is not the same throughout or has shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red. Diameter. The diameter of a mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil. Evolution. The mole is changing in size, shape, or color."
What causes a mole?,"These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people."
What is dysplastic nevi mole?,"Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Any changes in a mole should be checked by a dermatologist to evaluate for skin cancer."
What are lentigines?,"A lentigo (plural: lentigines) is a spot on the skin that is darker (usually brown) than the surrounding skin. Lentigines are more common among whites, especially those with fair skin."
What is a congenital nevi mole?,Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people. These moles are slightly more likely to develop into melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below).
Can lentigines be prevented?,"There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing it off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid using tanning beds."
What are skin tags?,"Skin tags are not dangerous. They are usually found on the neck, chest, back, armpits, under the breasts, or in the groin area. Skin tags appear most often in women, especially with weight gain, and in elderly people. Skin tags usually don't cause any pain. However, they can become irritated if anything, such as clothing, jewelry, or skin rubs against them. Your dermatologist can remove a skin tag by cutting it off with a scalpel or scissors, with cryosurgery (freezing it off), or with electrosurgery (burning it off with an electric current)."
What are common skin lesions?,"Freckles are extremely common and are not a health threat. They are more often seen in the summer, especially among lighter-skinned people and people with light or red hair. Causes of freckles include genetics and exposure to the sun."
What causes freckles?,Exposure to the sun seems to be the major cause of lentigines.
How do you know if a mole is cancer?,"The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 25. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, or become tender or painful."
How are seborrheic keratoses treated?,"Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and are not contagious. Therefore, they don't need to be treated. If you decide to have seborrheic keratoses removed because you don't like the way they look, or because they are chronically irritated by clothing, methods for removing them include cutting them off, cryosurgery, and electrosurgery."
How do advance directives help with a patient's home care for brain cancer?,"Advance directives are legal documents that provide a means to express your wishes for treatment and your choice on the person you want to make decisions on your behalf if you are not able to do so. Types of advance directives include a living will and durable power of attorney for health care. For example, a person with advanced brain cancer may not want to be put on a ventilator (breathing machine) if he or she stops breathing. You have the right to make these decisions for yourself as long as you are mentally competent."
What can home care do if I have brain cancer?,"For example, if you have trouble walking, physical and occupational therapists can help you improve movement and use equipment to aid in daily activities. A speech therapist can help with problems related to speaking and swallowing. Home health aides are specially trained to help with personal care tasks such as bathing, dressing, and eating. Home care can also include nurses to give medicines, provide wound care, and monitor side effects."
How can home hospice care help people with brain cancer?,"Home hospice care is a way of providing pain and symptom relief, as well as emotional and spiritual support for the patient and the family, at home rather than in the hospital. It involves a multidisciplinary approach that may include a doctor or other health care provider, nurses, a pharmacist, aides, a social worker, a spiritual caregiver, and counselors."
How long are patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) hospitalized?,The goal is to get the inflammation down quickly and stop the immune system attack. This will likely take a week or two in the hospital.
What are the best therapies for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"After the hospital, they may need some combination of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They may have to stay in a rehab hospital for a while, or maybe they can go home and work with a therapist."
What causes acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,Other symptoms include: Fever Headache Sleepiness Behavior changes such as fussiness or confusion Nausea and vomiting Seizures Coma ADEM seems to be an autoimmune disease. That means your immune system attacks your body's own cells and tissues as if they were outside bacteria or viruses.
What triggers acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"Experts don't know exactly what triggers it, but it could be an overreaction to an infection. Most of the time, the attack happens when a child is getting over some common illness, like a cold or stomach bug. ADEM sometimes follows an immunization, particularly certain rabies shots and the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. No direct connection has been made though. Other times, nothing out of the ordinary happens before symptoms appear."
What is the treatment for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children?,"Most people start with high doses of a powerful corticosteroid by IV for a few days. Your child may feel better within hours. They'll continue to take a steroid (as a pill or a liquid) for several weeks, in smaller and smaller doses. If your child can't have steroids or if they don't work, some procedures can calm the immune system. The doctor may filter their blood through a machine to remove the antibodies that their immune system is sending to attack the brain. This is called plasmapheresis. Or they could get shots of antibodies from a healthy person, which is called intravenous immunoglobulin treatment."
What is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"ADEM is a rare kind of inflammation that affects the brain and spinal cord. It damages the protective coating of nerve fibers, called myelin. Most often, children under age 10 will get it. While symptoms can be severe, they can be treated. Most people make a full recovery and don't have another attack."
How is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) diagnosed in kids?,"But MS is rare in children. Other differences can also help your doctor make the right diagnosis. Kids with ADEM may have a fever, a headache, seizures, or trouble thinking clearly. The disease usually appears soon after a viral illness. There's no such link with MS. An ADEM attack usually happens once, while multiple sclerosis involves many episodes over time. Tests of spinal fluid usually show certain proteins when you have MS, but not ADEM. With ADEM, spinal fluid usually has more white blood cells than normal. Damage to the brain from ADEM and damage caused by multiple sclerosis look different on an MRI. It's more widespread with ADEM. The doctor has to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms, too, like infections of the brain and spinal cord such as meningitis."
What is the outlook for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"Most of the time, a child who gets ADEM will recover completely. It will be a slow process, over 4 to 6 weeks. But it could be 6 months or up to a year before they're fully well. In some cases, kids don't get over all of their symptoms. They may have lasting vision damage or muscle weakness. They might have trouble in school if they've missed a lot of time, or perhaps as a lingering effect of the attack. About 8 times out of 10, ADEM happens only once. But sometimes you can get it again within a few months, especially if you don't take steroids for long enough. Your child might get MS later, but it's unlikely. In very rare cases, ADEM can be fatal."
Does therapy for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) usually continue after hospitalization?,"After the hospital, they may need some combination of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They may have to stay in a rehab hospital for a while, or maybe they can go home and work with a therapist. Your child's doctor will probably want a follow-up MRI to make sure the inflammation is gone and no new scars have formed."
How is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) differentiated from other conditions with similar symptoms?,"The condition has a lot in common with multiple sclerosis and other diseases that damage myelin. They share some symptoms, like muscle weakness, numbness, loss of vision, and loss of balance. But MS is rare in children. Other differences can also help your doctor make the right diagnosis. Kids with ADEM may have a fever, a headache, seizures, or trouble thinking clearly. The disease usually appears soon after a viral illness. There's no such link with MS. An ADEM attack usually happens once, while multiple sclerosis involves many episodes over time. Tests of spinal fluid usually show certain proteins when you have MS, but not ADEM.

How can diabetes cause dry eye?,"Most people with diabetes know that it can cause eye problems like retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. While infrequent, people with diabetes may have dry eyes, as well. That's because the nerve damage that causes you to lose feeling in your hands, legs, and feet -- so you don't notice cuts and sores -- can also affect your eyes. Severe dryness that's not treated can damage your cornea, the dome that covers the front part of your eye."

That's because pain in the chest can feel like heartburn. When in doubt, call your doctor."
How common is heartburn among pregnant women?,"More than half of all pregnant women experience heartburn during pregnancy. Increased hormones and pressure from a growing fetus can combine to produce this acid reflux symptom. In most cases, heartburn improves or completely goes away after delivery."
Are there potential complications with acid reflux symptoms?,"To lessen your symptoms, try avoiding: Citrus fruits Chocolate Caffeinated drinks or alcohol Spicy, fatty, or fried foods Garlic and onions Peppermint Tomatoes Usually, acid reflux symptoms cause no complications. In a few cases, continued esophageal damage can lead to scarring, which may cause the esophagus to narrow. The narrowing creates strictures and makes it difficult to swallow. You may have dysphagia, a sensation that food is stuck in your esophagus. In some cases, normal cells in the lining of the esophagus may be replaced by a different type of cell. This is called Barrett's esophagus, which can sometimes develop into cancer."
When should you call 911 about possible symptoms of a heart attack?,"Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms of heart attack: Chest pain, pressure, or fullness lasting more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back Pain or discomfort in your neck, shoulder, upper back, or jaw Shortness of breath, with or without chest pain Dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea Sweating along with chest pain"

Can a pregnant woman pass genital herpes to her baby?,"A pregnant woman can pass genital herpes on to her baby, so it's particularly serious during pregnancy. If you get infected near the end of pregnancy, the risk is highest. At least 30% and as many as 50% of newly infected pregnant women give the virus to their babies. For moms who were infected long before delivery, the risk is much lower. Less than 1% of babies born to mothers with an older genital herpes infection get the virus."
How can you reduce the risk of passing genital herpes to your partner?,"You can reduce the risk to your partner by having sex only when you have no symptoms. However, the virus can still be contagious without any noticeable symptoms such as sores or a rash on the skin. That's why you should always use a latex condom. A condom does not completely eliminate the risk, because it may not cover an affected area, but it does offer some protection. Taking the antiviral drugs acyclovir ( Zovirax), famciclovir ( Famvir), and valacyclovir ( Valtrex) can make symptoms appear less often and make them less severe."
How can I reduce the risk of getting pneumonia from people around me?,Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria and some viruses. So you need to make sure that people who touch you aren't transmitting any nasty germs.

If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine ( Adrenaclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room."
What are sensitive food allergies like?,"For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to."
What are the benefits of breastfeeding relative to food allergies?,"Doctors recommend only breastfeeding infants for the first 4-6 months, if possible, for many reasons, but there's no proof that it prevents food allergies later in life. While some pregnant women may hope limiting their diets while they're pregnant or breastfeeding may help their children avoid allergies, the experts disagree and don't suggest it. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either."
Can food allergies cause certain disorders?,"Although some people think certain illnesses can be caused by food allergies, evidence doesn't back up such claims. Histamines in cheese or red wine, for example, can trigger migraines. But we can't say that food allergies actually cause migraines. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis aren't made worse by foods. Food allergies don't cause ""allergic tension fatigue syndrome,"" where people get tired, nervous, and may have problems concentrating or headaches."
What are food allergens?,"And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body."

What is the process by which cancers metastasize to the bones?,"The spread of cancer to bone is a complex process that doctors are just beginning to understand. Metastasis typically involves the following process: Cancer cells invade normal tissue nearby, then move through the walls of nearby lymph or blood vessels and begin circulating through the lymphatic system and bloodstream to reach other parts of the body. After stopping in small blood vessels at a further location, they invade the blood vessel walls and migrate into surrounding tissue where they multiply and form smaller tumors. Those new tumors need a blood supply for continued growth, so they stimulate the growth of new blood vessels."
What are some treatments that can help relieve bone metastasis pain and other symptoms?,"These treatments for the bone can help relieve bone metastasis pain and other symptoms: Radiation therapy. High-energy X-rays can kill cancer cells or slow their growth. Alone or combined with other treatments, this can relieve symptoms of bone mets. Radiopharmaceuticals. Used only for cancer that spreads to bone, these are drugs with radioactive elements. When they are injected, they go to the bone with cancer, killing cancer cells and helping to relieve pain. Low blood counts can be a side effect of this type of therapy. Ablation. In this method, a needle is put directly into a tumor to destroy it with heat, cold, electric current, or alcohol. MRI- Guided Focused Ultrasound. This is a noninvasive procedure that uses ultrasound energy guided by MRI scanning to destroy nerve endings in the area of the tumor. The procedure is used to relieve pain in people who have not had success with radiation or who are unable to be treated with radiation. Bisphosphonates ( Aredia and Zometa). Given intravenously ( IV) for bone mets, these drugs can reduce damage to the bone, lower the risk of breaks, reduce high blood calcium levels, and lessen pain. Denosumab ( Xgeva). Similar to bisphosphonates, this drug is injected to help keep bone from breaking down. Surgery. If bone damage is severe, inserting a supportive rod may be a good option.

You'll need to work closely with your medical team to address your specific challenges with fatigue and fibro fog, because they're a little different for everyone. Do your part by taking steps to conserve energy and overcome concentration and memory issues to power through your day. Severe fatigue -- more than just being tired -- affects up to 4 out of 5 of people with fibromyalgia. It often goes hand-in-hand with sleepless nights."
Should you exercise if you have fibro fog and fatigue?,"Given how you feel, you may want to shy away from exercise. But it's one of the most effective ways to handle fibromyalgia. When you're too tired to exercise, that lack of activity leads to greater muscle weakness and more fatigue. Over time, regular exercise lessens fatigue. Consistency can have a greater impact than intensity. It's possible that exercise also creates a positive chain reaction that boosts brain function. Studies show a link between physical ability and thinking ability. People who can do more physically often do better in areas like attention and decision-making. Start out at an easy pace. Work with a physical therapist to find the right beginner program for you and adapt it as you get stronger. This is especially helpful if you're nervous about exercising. Strength training helps you regain muscle, and that helps with pain and fatigue for some people. Use resistance bands or a light weight to start. Very gentle movement therapies like yoga, tai chi, and qi gong all get you moving, but yoga often has best effect on fatigue."

How can you keep the cat litter box clean?,"1 rule, and the only thing that will keep litter box odor at bay, is constant cleaning. That means scooping the box out at least twice a day, removing the solids and liquid clumps if you use clumping litter. For those who don’t use clumping litter, use a large, solid metal spoon (such as a large kitchen spoon) to lift out the most urine-soaked areas each time you clean. Add litter as needed to replace what is removed. Also wash the box weekly, or every other week if you are using clumping litter. Use a mild, unscented dish detergent or a mild bleach spray (20 parts water to one part bleach) and rinse well. Clean your scooper also. When dry, add 2 to 3 inches of litter. Cats don’t like a deep tray of litter and this allows you to add litter as you scoop."
What types of cat litter box should you avoid?,"And avoid covered boxes. Most cats don’t like them, and they can trap odors inside, making it unpleasant for your pet to enter. Many cats also don’t like plastic liners, which can snare cat’s claws when they dig. This also allows urine to seep under the liner, where it won’t be absorbed by the litter and can cause odors. As for self-cleaning litter boxes, it depends. Some cats, especially skittish and large cats, may dislike them. But if your cat doesn’t mind, it’s an option for people who are gone for long periods."

How do shots treat uveitis?,"You may need these if your uveitis is in the middle or back of your eye, or if your eye drops don't work. The good news is that you may only need one shot. The bad news is that you'll get it in your eye, usually on the side. Your eye doctor can give you drops to numb the area so you don't feel the shot."
How do pills treat uveitis?,"If your uveitis doesn't respond to drops or shots, oral steroids are an option. They can also work if you have disease in the back of your eye. They're much stronger than other forms of steroids. Take your steroid pills for as long as your doctor says. Your dose will get smaller toward the end of your treatment. If the pills don't work, you'll probably try something else."
What can treatment for uveitis do?,"Your treatment plan should include things to control your inflammation. Treatment can also: Ease eye pain Prevent the damage to your eyes from getting worse Help get back eyesight you've lost What your doctor will prescribe depends on what kind of uveitis you have, where it is in your eye, and if you have it in both eyes. If your first course doesn't work well, your doctor can switch you to something else."
What can treat the symptoms of uveitis?,"They won't treat the cause of your uveitis: Drugs for mild pain, like ibuprofen A warm towel over your eye to ease aches Sunglasses in bright or harsh light to cut glare"
How does a vitrectomy treat uveitis?,"Your eye surgeon can take out part of the gel inside your eye, known as your vitreous humor. Air, gas, or liquid is pumped in to replace what your surgeon takes out, but your eye will eventually fill up the space with its own fluid. You can have this under either local or general anesthesia."
How does weight affect someone with diabetes getting pregnant?,"At this appointment, you and the doctor will discuss: Your weight: Try to reach your ideal body weight before you get pregnant. If you have a few extra pounds, losing them will help prevent complications from diabetes. If you're underweight, adding pounds can make you less likely to deliver a low-birth-weight baby."
Is blood sugar important during pregnancy?,"Your blood sugar: The doctor will check to see if your blood sugar is in control. This is key, because you may not know you're pregnant until the baby has been growing for 2-4 weeks. High blood sugar during the first 13 weeks can cause birth defects, lead to miscarriage, and put you at risk for diabetes complications."
What are some lifestyle changes that need to happen before someone with diabetes gets pregnant?,"Your lifestyle: If you smoke or drink alcohol, you'll need to stop. Smoking during pregnancy affects both you and the baby before, during, and after birth.

No amount of alcohol is known to be safe while pregnant, and there's no safe time during pregnancy to drink."
How will diabetes medications change during pregnancy?,"Your medications: You'll need more insulin during pregnancy, especially the last 3 months. The doctor will tell you how to adjust your dose. If you take diabetes pills, the doctor may switch you to insulin, because some of these drugs can harm the baby. So can some high blood pressure treatments used with diabetes. Bottom line: Discuss all medications you take with your doctor."
What is preconception counseling?,"At that visit, your doctor will: Order an A1 C test to find out if your diabetes is controlled well enough for you to stop using birth control Test your blood and urine for diabetes-related kidney complications Look for other problems linked with diabetes, like organ, nerve, or heart damage Take your blood pressure Rule out thyroid disease (if you have type 1 diabetes) Check your cholesterol and levels of a type of blood fat called triglycerides Suggest an eye exam to screen for glaucoma, cataracts, and retinopathy Recommend pre-conception counseling This is another important step for women with diabetes. This educational session will help you get physically and emotionally prepared -- and healthy -- for pregnancy."
Are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs safe or are there side effects?,"The FDA has approved all DMARDs. Many people take them without ever having problems. But because they work throughout the body to fight RA, their powerful action typically does cause some side effects, commonly: Stomach upset."
What are the side effects of using hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) are used for mild rheumatoid arthritis. They are not as powerful as other DMARDs, but they usually cause fewer side effects. In rare cases, Plaquenil can adversely affect the eyes, and patients taking this medicine should be seen by an ophthalmologist at least once a year."
How are the side effects of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) minimized?,"To minimize side effects, DMARDs are sometimes started one at a time and increased gradually. The goal is to minimize both rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and medication side effects. It often takes more than one DMARD to get control of active rheumatoid arthritis."
What are the effects of using disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"DMARDs slow down rheumatoid arthritis and improve quality of life for most people. Some will even achieve a remission while taking them. More commonly, the disease activity continues, but at a slower, less intense pace. While taking one or more DMARDs, you may have longer symptom-free periods, or flare ups that are less painful or stressful. Your joints may take less time to loosen up in the morning. At a check-up, your rheumatologist may end up telling you that your most recent X-rays are free of any new damage. Taking a DMARD regularly makes you less likely to have long-term damage to your joints, too."
What is cyclosporine and how does it treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Cyclosporine ( Neoral ) is a powerful drug that often works well in slowing down joint damage. But because it can hurt the kidneys and has other potential side effects, it is usually used for severe RA after other drugs fail and is not in widespread use at this time."

What biologic drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologic drugs: abatacept ( Orencia), adalimumab ( Humira), anakinra ( Kineret), certolizumab ( Cimzia), etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria), and infliximab ( Remicade). These are the newest drugs for RA and are either injected under the skin or given directly into a vein. They work by neutralizing one of the immune system's signals ( TNF) that lead to inflammation and joint damage. Rituximab ( Rituxan) and tocilizumab ( Actemra) are biologics, but do not block TNF. Rituxan target B cells and actemra affects IL-6."
What is azathioprine and how does it treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Azathioprine ( Imuran) is used for many different inflammatory conditions, including RA. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, sometimes with stomach pain and diarrhea. Long-term use of azathioprine is associated with an increased risk of cancer."
What is minocycline and how does it treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Minocycline ( Minocin) is an antibiotic that is not often prescribed. But it may help RA by stopping inflammation. It can take several months to start working and up to a year before the full effects are known. When taken for long periods, minocycline can cause discoloration of the skin."
What can you do to prevent viral pneumonia?,"If your lungs are invaded with bacteria, you might also get some of the same symptoms as bacterial pneumonia, like: A wet, gunky cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus Chills that make you shake Fatigue (feeling very tired) Low appetite Sharp or stabby chest pain, especially when you cough or take a deep breath Sweating a lot Fast breathing and heartbeat Blue lips and fingernails Confusion, especially if you're older You can do these things to help lower your odds of getting viral pneumonia: Get a flu shot every year. Wash your hands regularly, especially after you go to the bathroom and before you eat. Eat right, with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Exercise. Get enough sleep. Don't smoke. Stay away from people who are sick. Your doctor might be able to tell if you have viral pneumonia just by examining you and asking questions about your symptoms and general health."
How is viral pneumonia diagnosed?,"Your doctor might be able to tell if you have viral pneumonia just by examining you and asking questions about your symptoms and general health. Chances are your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. That's because certain sounds can mean fluid is in your lungs. But if your doctor isn't sure, you might have to get a chest X-ray."
What is osteoarthritis?,"Some of the more common types include: Osteoarthritis : This is the most common type of arthritis. It occurs when the cartilage covering the end of the bones gradually wears away. Without the protection of the cartilage, the bones begin to rub against each other and the resulting friction leads to pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, but most often affects the hands and weight-bearing joints such as the knee, hip, and facet joints (in the spine). Osteoarthritis often occurs as the cartilage breaks down, or degenerates, with age."
How does arthritis develop?,"With arthritis, an area in or around a joint becomes inflamed, causing pain, stiffness and, sometimes, difficulty moving. Some types of arthritis also affect other parts of the body, such as the skin and internal organs."

Although it may not be possible to prevent arthritis, there are steps to take to reduce your risk of developing the disease and to slow or prevent permanent joint damage."
Can your genes make you more likely to get arthritis?,Certain types of arthritis run in families and are at least partially inherited.
What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"Rheumatoid arthritis: RA is a long-lasting disease that can affect joints in any part of the body, but most commonly involves the hands, wrists, and knees. With rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system -- the body's defense system against disease -- mistakenly attacks the body's jointsand causes the joint lining to swell. The inflammation then spreads to the surrounding tissues, and can eventually damage cartilage and bone. In more severe cases, rheumatoid arthritis can affect other areas of the body, such as the skin, eyes, and nerves."
Can being overweight make you more likely to get arthritis?,"Being overweight puts extra stress on weight-bearing joints, increasing wear and tear, and increasing the risk of arthritis, especially osteoarthritis."
Should I check with my doctor before I start a fitness program if I have multiple sclerosis?,"Check with your doctor before you start any fitness program. He may suggest: Types of exercise that are best for you and those you should avoid. The right moves depend on your symptoms, fitness level, and overall health. How long and intense your workouts should be Any physical limitations for your routines Other professionals, like a physical therapist, who can help you build a personal exercise program that meets your needs Aerobics."
What should you do if you get overheated from exercising and you have multiple sclerosis?,"If you're sensitive to heat, your symptoms may show up or get worse when your body temperature rises. This will happen when you exercise. To avoid overheating: Don't exercise during the hottest part of the day (10 a.m. to 2 p.m.). Try to work out in the morning or evening if you're exercising outside. Drink plenty of cool water. Be aware of your body. If you notice any symptoms you didn't have before you started exercising, slow down or stop until you cool down. Swimming and water aerobics are good ways to stay cool while you work out. Just make sure there are non-slip floors in the locker room and around the pool."
How should I exercise to help ease the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?,"Exercise can help ease multiple sclerosis symptoms, but you have to be careful if you want your workouts to work for you. The most important thing: Don't overdo it. No doubt you've heard the sayings ""no pain, no gain"" or ""feel the burn,"" but that isn't good advice when you have MS. Do too much and you can strain your muscles, increase pain, and put too much stress on your body and your mind. Never exercise to the point of fatigue."

Some people have a heart attack without having any symptoms (a ""silent"" myocardial infarction). A silent MI can occur in anyone, though it is more common among diabetics."
"After a heart attack, when should I see my doctor after I leave the hospital?","Make a doctor's appointment for two to six weeks after leaving the hospital. Your doctor will want to check the progress of your recovery. She may ask you to undergo diagnostic tests (such as an exercise stress test or echocardiogram at regular intervals). These tests can help your doctor diagnose the presence or progression of blockages in your coronary arteries and plan treatment. Call your doctor sooner if you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath -- especially at rest, dizziness, or irregular heartbeats."
Iâve had a heart attack. How can I prevent another one?,"The goal after a heart attack is to keep the heart healthy and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. Your best opportunities to ward off future attacks is to take your medications, change your lifestyle, and see your doctor for regular heart checkups."
"Whatâs the purpose of drugs that treat a heart attack, and when should they be given?","The goals of drug therapy are to break up or prevent blood clots, prevent platelets from gathering and sticking to the plaque, stabilize the plaque, and prevent further damage. These medications must be given as soon as possible to decrease the amount of heart damage. The longer the delay in starting these drugs, the more damage can occur and the less benefit they can provide."
What is Friedreich's ataxia?,Friedreich ataxia: Problems related to a protein called frataxin cause nerve damage and often heart problems.
What are metal metabolism disorders?,"Metal metabolism disorders: Levels of trace metals in the blood are controlled by special proteins. Inherited metabolic disorders can result in protein malfunction and toxic accumulation of metal in the body: Wilson disease (toxic copper levels accumulate in the liver, brain, and other organs) Hemochromatosis (the intestines absorb excessive iron, which builds up in the liver, pancreas, joints, and heart, causing damage) Organic acidemias: methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia."

A few major examples of metabolism include: Breaking down the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food to release energy. Transforming excess nitrogen into waste products excreted in urine. Breaking down or converting chemicals into other substances and transporting them inside cells."
What are treatments for inherited metabolic disorders?,"Treatment may include such measures as: Special diets that eliminate certain nutrients Taking enzyme replacements, or other supplements that support metabolism Treating the blood with chemicals to detoxify dangerous metabolic by-products Whenever possible, a person with an inherited metabolic disorder should receive care at a medical center with experience with these rare conditions."
What are inherited metabolic disorders?,"Metabolism is an organized but chaotic chemical assembly line. Raw materials, half-finished products, and waste materials are constantly being used, produced, transported, and excreted. The ""workers"" on the assembly line are enzymes and other proteins that make chemical reactions happen. In most inherited metabolic disorders, a single enzyme is either not produced by the body at all or is produced in a form that doesn't work. The missing enzyme is like an absentee worker on the assembly line. Depending on that enzyme's job, its absence means toxic chemicals may build up, or an essential product may not be produced."
What are peroxisomal disorders?,"Peroxisomal disorders: Similar to lysosomes, peroxisomes are tiny spaces filled with enzymes inside cells. Poor enzyme function inside peroxisomes can lead to buildup of toxic products of metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders include: Zellweger syndrome (abnormal facial features, enlarged liver, and nerve damage in infants) Adrenoleukodystrophy (symptoms of nerve damage can develop in childhood or early adulthood depending on the form.)"
How should I adjust my devices to prevent eyestrain?,"You can also make sure your devices are set for eye health. Raise the contrast on your screen. Make text larger. Change the brightness of the screen. It shouldn't be lighter or darker than your surroundings. Lower the color temperature of your screen. That means it will give off less blue light, which is linked to more eyestrain. Raise the device's refresh rate. That will cause less flickering of the screen."
How can I prevent digital eyestrain?,"But a few changes to how your use your devices can be easier on your eyes. Make sure your computer screen is about 25 inches, or an arm's length, away from your face. The center of the screen should be about 10-15 degrees below eye level. Cut glare by using a matte screen filter. You can find them for all types of computers, phones, and tablets. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Take a longer break of about 15 minutes after every 2 hours you spend on your devices. Use artificial tears to refresh your eyes when they feel dry. Try putting a humidifier in the room where you most often use a computer or other device. Make sure the lighting in the room you're in is bright enough. You don't want your device to be brighter than the surroundings. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing your glasses. Get regular eye exams. You might need to use a different pair of glasses when you're working on a computer."

It shows up in the same joints on both sides of your body, like both wrists or both hips."
How do you know if rheumatoid arthritis is in your joints?,"RA almost always affects your joints. It may take a few weeks or months for the first signs to show. The inflammation it causes results in classic symptoms like: Stiffness. The joint is harder to use and doesn't move as well as it should. It's especially common in the morning. While many people with other forms of arthritis have stiff joints in the morning, it takes people with rheumatoid arthritis more than an hour (sometimes several hours) before their joints feel loose. Swelling. Fluid in the joint makes it puffy and tender. Pain. Inflammation inside a joint makes it hurt whether you're moving it or not. Over time, it causes damage and pain. Redness and warmth. The joints may be warmer and show color changes related to the inflammation."
How can rheumatoid arthritis  affect your heart?,"Likewise, RA can inflame the lining around your heart (called pericarditis) or your heart muscle (called myocarditis). You probably wouldn't notice symptoms from that. There's a chance you could feel shortness of breath or chest pain."
Does rheumatoid arthritis cause pain?,Fluid in the joint makes it puffy and tender. Pain.
Can rheumatoid arthritis affect your lungs?,This may not cause symptoms. But you might notice shortness of breath. Your doctor can treat it with drugs that ease the inflammation in the lungs.

How do you know if rheumatoid arthritis affects the entire body?,"Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms can go beyond your joints. You could also feel: Fatigue Muscle aches Poor appetite Bad all over (your doctor may call this malaise) Depression Extreme fatigue could be a sign of anemia, or a lack of healthy red blood cells."
Can rheumatoid arthritis inflame areas around your heart?,"Likewise, RA can inflame the lining around your heart (called pericarditis) or your heart muscle (called myocarditis). You probably wouldn't notice symptoms from that. There's a chance you could feel shortness of breath or chest pain."
Can rheumatoid arthritis affect your voice box?,"It doesn't happen often, but RA can also affect a joint in your voice box."
What are symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"Some people get flu-like symptoms within a month after they've been infected, but these symptoms often go away within a month. You could have HIV for many years before feeling ill at all. Before you're diagnosed with HIV, you may get shingles. If you have had HIV for many years, you may get other infections related to advance HIV pr AIDS (see below). Both women and men may get thrush, a kind of yeast infection in your mouth or on your tongue. Women could get severe vaginal yeast infections."
What is a carbuncle?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A carbuncle is a red, swollen, and painful cluster of boils that are connected to each other under the skin. A boil (or furuncle) is an infection of a hair follicle that has a small collection of pus (called an abscess) under the skin. Usually single, a carbuncle is most likely to occur on a hairy area of the body such as the back or nape of the neck. But a carbuncle also can develop in other areas of the body such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, and armpits."
What are complications of carbuncles?,"Sometimes, carbuncles are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA) bacteria, and require treatment with potent prescription antibiotics if the lesions are not drained properly. In rare cases, bacteria from a carbuncle can escape into the bloodstream and cause serious complications, including sepsis and infections in other parts of the body such as the lung, bones, joints, heart, blood, and central nervous system. Sepsis is an overwhelming infection of the body that is a medical emergency and can be fatal if left untreated. Symptoms include chills, a spiking fever, rapid heart rate, and a feeling of being extremely ill."
What is the home treatment for carbuncles?,"The cardinal rule is to avoid squeezing or irritating a carbuncle, which increases the risk of complications and severe scarring. Warm compresses may promote the drainage and healing of carbuncles. Gently soak the carbuncle in warm water, or apply a clean, warm, moist washcloth for 20 minutes several times per day. Similar strategies include covering the carbuncle with a clean, dry cloth and gently applying a heating pad or hot water bottle for 20 minutes several times per day. After each use, washcloths or cloths should be washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature. Washing the carbuncle and covering the area with a sterile bandage also may promote drainage and healing and help prevent the infection from spreading. Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain of an inflamed carbuncle. It's important to thoroughly wash your hands after touching a carbuncle. Launder any clothing, bedding, and towels that have touched a carbuncle and avoid sharing bedding, clothing, or other personal items."
What should I know about carbuncles?,"Carbuncles are more likely than boils to leave scars. An active boil or carbuncle is contagious: the infection can spread to other parts of the person's body or to other people through skin-to-skin contact or the sharing of personal items. So it's important to practice appropriate self-care measures, like keeping the area clean and covered, until the carbuncle drains and heals. Carbuncles require medical treatment to prevent or manage complications, promote healing, and minimize scarring. Contact your doctor if you have a boil or boils that have persisted for more than a few days."
How long do carbuncles take to heal?,"But treatment with antibiotics may be necessary in cases such as: When MRSA is involved and drainage is incomplete There is surrounding soft-tissue infection (cellulitis) A person has a weakened immune system An infection has spread to other parts of the body Depending on severity, most carbuncles heal within two to three weeks after medical treatment."
What causes carbuncles?,"Most carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, which inhabit the skin surface, throat, and nasal passages. These bacteria can cause infection by entering the skin through a hair follicle, small scrape, or puncture, although sometimes there is no obvious point of entry."
What are tests to diagnose atherosclerosis?,Diseases caused by atherosclerosis are the most common cause of death in the U. S. The one test that can directly show blocked arteries is called angiography. It's an invasive test: A thin tube is put inside an artery in the leg or arm. It's then threaded through the body's maze of branching arteries. Injected dye shows arteries -- and any blockages -- on a monitor.
How does an electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) help in diagnosing =?,Electron beam computed tomography ( EBCT): A special CT scanner ( CAT scan) snaps pictures of the heart. A computer figures out the amount of calcium in your heart's arteries. More calcium can mean more atherosclerosis.
How does angiography help in diagnosing atherosclerosis?,"Angiography: This test can show a picture of blockages caused by atherosclerosis. It can be done on arteries in your heart, brain, or legs. Because it has some risk, angiography is usually done only on people with symptoms from their atherosclerosis. Typically, this means people with symptoms of blockages, such as chest pain."
How does a stress test help in diagnosing atherosclerosis?,"Once your doctor has identified your risk group, more tests may be needed, such as: Stress test: With medicines or walking on an exercise treadmill, your heart is made to pump almost as hard as it can. That allows your doctor to see what symptoms you may have. If needed, images of the heart or EKGs can show any blockages."
What happens when you get a cortisone injection?,"The doctor, nurse, or other health professional will use an alcohol or iodine-based cleaning solution to clean the area of your skin where you'll get the shot. After that, they will put a numbing lotion or spray on that spot. Then you'll get the shot. Afterward, you'll wear a bandage over the injection site.

Then you read a gauge to find your blood pressure. These are the least expensive options, but they're also easy to damage. Digital monitors: On some models you inflate the cuff. On others the machine does it for you. Your reading appears on a small screen. Some even offer a paper printout. They're easy to use and read."
What can you expect during a lip augmentation procedure?,"Injectable lip augmentation techniques can be performed quickly in your doctor's office with little to no downtime. Fat injection is the exception, since the procedure requires a small area of liposuction to remove the fat from another part of your body before the injection can take place. Before the injections, a topical or local numbing agent may be applied to ease discomfort. Sometimes, nerve block injections can be given before the treatment to completely numb the lips. This is similar to the anesthetic injections that you get at the dentist to numb your mouth. After carefully marking the areas to be injected, very fine needles are used to inject the substance into your lips."

What is the process for creating an Individualized Education Program (IEP)?,"The next step after evaluation is the IEP meeting, which is required by law. The Individualized Education Program is supposed to address all aspects of your child's education. So, a number of different people will need to attend the meeting. At the very least, the meeting should include you, your child's teacher, and a special education teacher. Others who are familiar with different aspects of your child's needs and abilities -- social workers, school psychologists, therapists, or doctors -- also should attend. When appropriate, your child may also participate and offer input at the meeting."
Who determines eligibility for an Individualized Education Program (IEP)?,"Professionals within your child's district are usually the ones who do the evaluation, but it can also be done by a developmental pediatrician or psychologist. The evaluation is what determines that your child is eligible for special education. It also helps identify the special services your child might need. If you think your child's evaluation isn't accurate, you can ask for an independent evaluation. That will be done by a professional from outside the school district. Your child's district may pay for that evaluation."
How should I prepare for a meeting about my child's Individualized Education Program (IEP)?,"That team will discuss how to best meet your child's educational needs. To prepare for the meeting -- and if your child is able to articulate answers -- you may find it helpful to ask your child questions about school such as: "" What is your favorite subject?"" "" What is the hardest thing for you at school?"" "" What is the easiest thing for you at school?"""
How does an Individualized Education Program (IEP) help a child with autism?,"Many children with ASD find it difficult to develop the skills they need. Engaging a child or teen in the IEP process provides an opportunity to teach a child with autism to advocate for himself or herself. For some children, involvement may be limited to attending the IEP meeting. Over time, and depending upon the degree of the disability, some children may be able to take more ownership. When they do, they will more actively participate in designing their IEP for autism. They may be able to identify their own problem areas and help create reasonable goals for themselves."
How can lupus affect your heart and lungs?,"Heart and lung involvement often is caused by inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericardium) and lungs (pleura). When these structures become inflamed, patients may develop chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleuritis or pleurisy) and heart (pericarditis). The heart valves and the lung itself can also be affected by lupus, resulting in shortness of breath."

One particular type of lupus that generally affects only the skin is called ""discoid lupus."" With this type of lupus, the skin problems consist of large red, circular rashes that may scar. Skin rashes are usually aggravated by sunlight. A common lupus rash called subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is often worse after exposure to the sun. This type of rash can affect the arms, legs, and torso. An uncommon but serious form of lupus rash results in the development of large blisters and is called a ""bullous"" lupus rash."
What is an antinuclear antibody test for lupus?,"An antinuclear antibody ( ANA) test is a sensitive screening tool used to detect autoimmune diseases, including lupus. Antinuclear antibodies ( ANAs) are antibodies that are directed against certain structures within a cell's nucleus (thus, antinuclear antibody). ANAs are found in particular patterns in people with autoimmune diseases (those in which a person's immune system works against his or her own body). An ANA test is done on a sample of a person's blood. The test determines the strength of the antibodies by measuring how many times the person's blood must be diluted to get a sample that is free of antibodies."

Understanding the illness can help you know what to expect, and provide better support and understanding. Don't push. Give your loved one enough space to deal with the illness and regain some control over his or her life. When possible, go with the person to the doctor. This is a good way to offer support and to listen to what the doctor says. Sometimes, a person feels overwhelmed and cannot take in everything the doctor says. Encourage the person to take care of himself or herself and to follow the doctor's treatment plan, but do it gently. Be patient and don't nag. Be open with the person. Talk about your own fears and concerns, and ask the person about his or her fears and needs."

What factors may contribute to the development of lupus?,This drug weakens the immune system by targeting a protein that may reduce the abnormal B cells thought to contribute to lupus.
Does a positive antinuclear antibody test mean that I have lupus?,"Not necessarily. The antinuclear antibody ( ANA) test is positive in most people who have lupus, but it also may be positive in many people who are healthy or have another autoimmune disease. Therefore, a positive ANA test alone is not adequate for the diagnosis of lupus. There must be at least three additional clinical features from the list of 11 features for the diagnosis to be made."
How is rheumatrex (methotrexate) used to treat lupus?,"Another chemotherapy drug used to suppress the immune system.

It's usually a symptom of an underlying condition, most often an infection. Fever is usually associated with physical discomfort, and most people feel better when a fever is treated. But depending on your age, physical condition, and the underlying cause of your fever, you may or may not require medical treatment for the fever alone. Many experts believe that fever is a natural bodily defense against infection. There are also many non-infectious causes of fever. Fever is generally not considered dangerous, but hyperthermia can cause dangerous rises in body temperature. This can be due to an extreme temperature associated with heat injury such as heat stroke, side effects of certain medications or illicit drugs, and stroke. With hyperthermia, the body is no longer able to control body temperature. In children with fever, accompanying symptoms such as lethargy, fussiness, poor appetite, sore throat, cough, ear pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are important to relay to your doctor."

What is the vitreous in the eye?,It's bathed in moisture from a clear jelly known as the vitreous.
What is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the eye?,These cells absorb excess light so the photoreceptors can give a clearer signal. They also move nutrients to (and waste from) the photoreceptors to the choroid. The choroid is separate from the RPE.
What are photoreceptors?,They're special nerve endings that convert the light into electrochemical signals.
Where does the light that enters the eye go?,"Its final destination is the retina, which lines the back of your eye. It's like the screen in a movie theater or the film in a camera. The focused light hits cells called photoreceptors."
How does the lens of the eye work?,"It circulates throughout the front part of your eye and keeps pressure inside constant After the aqueous humor, light passes through the pupil. This is the central round opening in your iris, the colored part of your eye. It changes size to control how much light gets in farther back. Next up is the lens. It works just like a camera to focus light. It adjusts shape depending on whether the light reflects off something near to you or far away."
"What is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), choroid, and sclera in the retina?","These cells absorb excess light so the photoreceptors can give a clearer signal. They also move nutrients to (and waste from) the photoreceptors to the choroid. The choroid is separate from the RPE. It lies behind the retina and is made up of many fine blood vessels that supply nutrition to the retina and the RPE. Sclera is the tough, white, fibrous outside wall of your eye. It's connected to the clear cornea in front."
"What are the blood vessels, macula, and photoreceptors in the retina?","Unlike a movie screen, the retina has many parts: Blood vessels bring nutrients to your nerve cells. The macula is the bull's-eye at the center of your retina. The dead center is called the fovea. Because it's the focal point of your eye, it has more special, light-sensitive nerve endings, called photoreceptors, than any other part. Photoreceptors come in two kinds: rods and cones. They're special nerve endings that convert the light into electrochemical signals."
What happens after light enters the pupil?,"It circulates throughout the front part of your eye and keeps pressure inside constant After the aqueous humor, light passes through the pupil. This is the central round opening in your iris, the colored part of your eye. It changes size to control how much light gets in farther back. Next up is the lens.

Babies at this age haven't yet assigned meaning to words. Wait another couple of months and those ''ma-mas'' and ''da-das'' will be directed at you. At five months, babies are starting to make sense of the sounds they hear, such as a dog barking or a car engine starting. Though they can't yet understand words, they may turn their head at the sound of their name or a simple command like ''no.''"
What motor skills milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"Five-month-old babies can sit upright for longer periods of time. Your baby probably still needs to be propped up with a pillow or Boppy, but he may also be able to sit unsupported for a few seconds at a time. Some 5-month-olds can start rolling over from their back to their tummy. Once your baby does roll over, you may notice him working his legs and rocking. He's getting ready for crawling and scooting, which are just a couple of months away! But remember, when baby is able to roll over, make sure you never leave him on a bed or other high surface where he can accidentally roll off and get injured.

Consider removing the mobile hanging over your baby's crib. Once babies can push up onto their hands and knees, they can get caught up in the mobile's hanging cords. If you haven't baby-proofed your house by now, make sure you do it soon. Cover all electrical outlets, place household cleaners and other hazardous materials in locked cabinets, and put away all choking hazards. Also be very careful about not leaving steaming mugs of coffee or curling irons on countertops where your baby might pull them down."
What senses milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"Your 5-month-old's vision is continuing to improve.

What is the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's disease?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Dementia is the name for a group of brain disorders that make it hard to remember, think clearly, make decisions, or even control your emotions. Alzheimer's disease is one of those disorders, but there are many different types and causes of dementia. Dementia isn't just about simple memory mishaps -- like forgetting someone's name or where you parked. A person with dementia has a hard time with at least two of the following: Memory Communication and speech Focus and concentration Reasoning and judgment Visual perception (can't see the difference in colors or detect movement, or sees things that aren't there) Since some types of dementia share similar symptoms, it can be hard for a doctor to figure out which one you or your loved one has. Be sure to tell him about all symptoms, medication and alcohol use, and previous illnesses to help him make the right diagnosis."
Why should you make an appointment for Alzheimer's now?,"The sooner you know, the better. Starting treatment may help relieve symptoms and keep you independent longer. It also helps you plan better. You can work out living arrangements, make financial and legal decisions, and build up your support network."
What are warning signs of Alzheimer's?,Words and conversations are frustrating Vocabulary becomes hard.
What are some other causes of hypothermia?,The risk of cold exposure increases as the winter months arrive.
Who is at risk for hypothermia?,"People at increased risk for hypothermia include: The elderly, infants, and children without adequate heating, clothing, or food People with mental illness People who are outdoors for extended periods People in cold weather whose judgment is impaired by alcohol or drugs Recognizing the symptoms is the first step in diagnosing hypothermia."
How does cold exposure cause hypothermia?,"During exposure to cold temperatures, most heat loss -- up to 90% -- escapes through your skin; the rest, you exhale from your lungs. Heat loss through the skin happens primarily through radiation and speeds up when skin is exposed to wind or moisture. If cold exposure is due to being immersed in cold water, heat loss can occur 25 times faster than it would if exposed to the same air temperature. The hypothalamus, the brain's temperature-control center, works to raise body temperature by triggering processes that heat and cool the body. During cold temperature exposure, shivering is a protective response to produce heat through muscle activity. In another heat-preserving response -- called vasoconstriction -- blood vessels temporarily narrow. Normally, the activity of the heart and liver produce most of your body heat. But as core body temperature cools, these organs produce less heat, in essence causing a protective ""shut down"" to preserve heat and protect the brain. Low body temperature can slow brain activity, breathing, and heart rate. Confusion and fatigue can set in, hampering a person's ability to understand what's happening and make intelligent choices to get to safety."

For this exam, the doctor inserts a finger into your rectum to feel the area of the coccyx and determine if there is a dislocation or a fracture that can be felt and if direct pressure against the coccyx reproduces your pain. Rarely, if the cause of discomfort is unknown, a local anesthetic may be injected into the tailbone area to determine whether the origin of the pain is from the coccyx or another part of the vertebral column. X-rays may be taken to determine whether there is a fracture or dislocation. However, X-rays occasionally may not reveal these injuries. Some doctors recommend X-rays in both the standing and seated positions to better determine the presence of a fracture or dislocation."

Experts believe that people who get frequent headaches have a greater sensitivity to changes in the environment. They also have a lower threshold to the pain response. The reason, they suspect, is that people who get migraine headaches have likely inherited this sensitivity. The survey cited earlier also found that two out of three headache sufferers had not discussed environmental triggers with their doctors. Nearly half of them, though, had been plagued by headaches for more than 20 years."
Should I get antibiotics for a cold?,"Antibiotics fight bacteria, but that won't help your cold, which is caused by a virus.

Three medications can be purchased over the counter -- budesonide ( Rhinocort Allergy), fluticasone ( Flonase Allergy Relief), and triamcinolone ( Nasacort Allergy 24 HR). Side effects can include headache, sore throat, nosebleed, or cough."
What are steroid nasal sprays?,"These sprays work very well to reduce congestion, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. They also help stop a drippy nose. They're often the first drug recommended for allergies, but it takes about a week before you'll notice your symptoms getting better."
What is the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)?,"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) is a nonprofit alliance of 27 cancer centers throughout the U. S. Experts from NCCN cancer centers diagnose and treat all cancers, with a particular focus on complex, aggressive, or uncommon cancers."
When should you call your doctor about eczema?,"You develop an itchy rash and have a family history of eczema or asthma. The inflammation doesn't respond within a week to treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams. You may need more aggressive forms of treatment. You develop yellowish to light brown crust or pus-filled blisters over existing patches of eczema. This may indicate a bacterial infection that should be treated with an antibiotic. During a flare-up of eczema, you are exposed to anyone with a viral skin disease such as cold sores or genital herpes. Having eczema puts you at increased risk of contracting the herpes simplex virus. You develop numerous painful, small, fluid-filled blisters in the areas of eczema. You may have eczema herpeticum, a rare but potentially serious complication caused by the herpes simplex virus."
Whatâs the purpose of clinical trials for lymphoma drugs and treatments?,"Major pharmaceutical companies continually research and develop new cancer drugs and treatments, which must be shown to be safe and effective before they are FDA approved for use and doctors can prescribe them to patients. Through lymphoma clinical trials, researchers test the effects of new medications or treatment regimens on a group of volunteers with lymphoma. Following a strict protocol and using carefully controlled conditions, researchers evaluate the drugs under development and measure the ability of the new drug to treat lymphoma, its safety, and any possible side effects."
How is vitiligo diagnosed and treated?,"There's no known way to prevent or cure the condition. But you can improve the appearance of affected skin with cosmetics and corticosteroid creams. Your doctor can also try re-pigmenting the white skin using UV light therapy or lightening the skin in unaffected areas, or a skin graft."
Who's likely to get vitiligo?,"Up to 2% of the population and an estimated 2 to 5 million Americans have the condition. It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. In most cases, it develops early in life, between ages 10 and 30. It will almost always show up before age 40. Vitiligo may run in families. You're more likely to get it when someone else in your family has it, too, or when people in your family get gray hair prematurely. Autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease ( Hashimoto's thyroiditis) or type 1 diabetes, can also raise your odds."
What are the symptoms of vitiligo?,"You'll often lose pigment quickly on several areas of your skin. After the white patches appear, they may stay the same for a while, but later on, they might get bigger. You may have cycles of pigment loss and stability. Vitiligo commonly affects body folds (such as armpits), places that have been injured in the past, and areas exposed to sun, around moles, or around body openings. It can also affect eyelids and hair. It's rare for pigment to return once the white patches have developed."
How do insulin pumps deliver insulin?,"Between meals and overnights, a small amount of insulin is constantly delivered to keep the blood sugar in the target range. This is called the basal rate. When food is eaten, a bolus dose of insulin can be programmed into the pump. You can measure how much of a bolus you need using calculations based on the grams of carbohydrates consumed."
Why should I use an insulin pump for diabetes?,Some health care providers prefer the insulin pump for diabetes because its slow release of insulin mimics how a normally working pancreas would release insulin. One large study concluded the insulin pump is a safe and valuable treatment option for those with poorly controlled blood sugar. Another advantage of the insulin pump is that it frees you from having to measure insulin into a syringe.
How is dementia treated?,"Dementia treatment is directed toward managing symptoms, and identifying whether or not there may be a reversible cause. Medicines such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., galantamine, donepezil) can sometimes help to slow the progression of cognitive changes, but quite often the effects of medicines are only modest and cannot prevent eventual worsening of the underlying condition. Agitation and other emotional concerns are generally addressed as part of the overall treatment plan."
How are skin and arthritis conditions associated with hepatitis C?,"Skin and Arthritis Conditions and Hepatitis C Two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda, have been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. Porphyria cutanea tarda may resolve with successful interferon therapy for the hepatitis C virus. There have been cases, however, where lichen planus actually worsened during interferon treatment. In addition, many hepatitis C virus patients have autoimmune antibodies, such as anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. But true rheumatoid arthritis is uncommon in people with hepatitis C virus."
How is cryoglobulinemia relative to hepatitis C diagnosed?,"In this test, the cryoglobulins are identified when the blood sample is exposed to the cold (cryo means cold). In addition, a finding of typical inflammation of small blood vessels in certain tissue biopsies (for example, the skin or kidney) supports the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. Symptoms of cryoglobulinemia often resolve with successful treatment of the hepatitis C virus infection. B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hepatitis C B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph tissue, has also been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. The cause is thought to be the excessive stimulation by the hepatitis C virus of B-lymphocytes, which results in the abnormal reproduction of the lymphocytes."
How is B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated with hepatitis C?,"B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hepatitis C B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph tissue, has also been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. The cause is thought to be the excessive stimulation by the hepatitis C virus of B-lymphocytes, which results in the abnormal reproduction of the lymphocytes. Interestingly, treatment with interferon therapy and some newer direct-acting antiviral treatments have caused some cases of hepatitis C virus-associated low-grade (not very active) non- Hodgkin's lymphoma to go into remission. However, most individuals with hepatitis C virus-associated high-grade non- Hodgkin's lymphoma will require the usual anti-cancer therapies."
How can exposure and response prevention (ERP) help with treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?,"Exposure and response prevention ( ERP). This is a specific form of CBT. As the name suggests, you'll be exposed to the things that trigger your anxiety, a little at a time. You'll learn new ways to respond to them in place of your repetitive rituals. ERP is a process you may do one-on-one with your mental health professional or in group therapy, either by yourself or with your family there."
How can I get more protein after getting breast cancer surgery?,"Your body needs more of it than usual after your operation. It needs it to repair cells, fight infection, and heal incisions.

Ask your doctor whether eating one to three servings of soy a day would help you. It's possible it may interfere with hormone therapy or some other treatment."
What are some dietary guidelines to follow after breast cancer surgery?,"Eat low-fat protein, such as roasted chicken and baked fish, rather than steak, sausages, or other high-fat meats. Try to have five servings of a wide variety of vegetables and fruits each day. Avoid processed meats linked to cancer. These include bacon, bologna, hot dogs, ham, and smoked meats. Choose whole-grain bread and brown rice, rather than white bread and white rice. Cut back on alcohol. Limit yourself to one drink a day if you're a woman or two if you're a man. Talk to your doctor about any diet changes you're making, especially when recovering from surgery or when getting chemotherapy. You don't want to starve your body of important nutrients that it needs to recover."
Why are antioxidants necessary after breast cancer surgery?,"Many vegetables, fruits, nuts, and other foods have them. Good choices include broccoli, liver, carrots, blueberries, and mangoes. Antioxidants protect your cells from damage. Dietitians say you should eat a balanced diet with a variety of fresh foods to get them. It's better for you than taking supplements."
How often should someone exercise after breast cancer surgery?,"Aim to get 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week -- unless your doctor says not to. Go slowly and safely in the months after your surgery."
How do soy help patients recover from breast cancer surgery?,"Soybeans contain phytoestrogens. These are nutrients similar to the estrogen in your body. Sources of them include soybeans (edamame), tofu, soy milk, and miso soup. Some researchers think they can help protect against the kind of breast cancer that needs estrogen for its growth, but others don't. Ask your doctor whether eating one to three servings of soy a day would help you. It's possible it may interfere with hormone therapy or some other treatment."
How can beta-carotene help with recover from breast cancer surgery?,"Carrots, apricots, yams, and other vegetables and fruits get their orange color from beta-carotene. Eating foods that have a lot of it may lower the risk of breast cancer returning, some studies suggest."

The doctor will consider your symptoms and overall health when deciding what treatment plan is best for you. The goal of treatment is to carefully lower your blood pressure within a matter of minutes. You will receive blood pressure medicines through an IV, which is the quickest way to treat extremely high blood pressure. Once blood pressure is at a safe level, the medications may be switched to oral forms. If you develop kidney failure, you may need kidney dialysis. Other treatments depend on your specific symptoms and possible causes of the malignant hypertension."
Why can malignant hypertension cause kidney problems?,"Symptoms include: Blindness Changes in mental status Coma Confusion Drowsiness Headache that continues to get worse Nausea and vomiting Seizures High blood pressure, in general, makes it difficult for kidneys to filter wastes and toxins from the blood. It is a leading cause of kidney failure. Malignant hypertension can cause your kidneys to suddenly stop working properly."

That means no more than one drink a day for women, and no more than two for men."
How do I know if my plastic baby bottles have BPA in them?,"The ban on BPA means you can confidently buy new plastic baby bottles, knowing that they are free of the potentially harmful chemical. If you are using older plastic bottles, for example bottles given to you by family members, check the recycling symbol on the bottom. The symbol #7 or the label PC (which stands for polycarbonate) is a sign that the bottle likely contains BPA.

Replace any glass bottles that have cracks or chips in them."
What should I know about an aortic aneurysm?,"During your lifetime it will pump enough blood to fill about three supertankers. The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. Although your aorta is a tough, durable workhorse, sometimes its walls can weaken and bulge in what is called an aortic aneurysm. This could cause a leak that spills blood into your body. Some aortic aneurysms burst, some don't. Others force blood flow away from your organs and tissues, causing problems, such as heart attacks, kidney damage, stroke, and even death."
What can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"Doctors don't really know what causes an abdominal aortic aneurysm, although they suspect a few things might play a role: Hardening of the arteries, which doctors also call atherosclerosis Smoking High blood pressure Genetic predisposition Doctors also think the risks increase if you injure yourself, have an infection, or if your blood vessels become inflamed."

What should one expect after a root canal?,"For the first few days following the completion of a root canal, the tooth may feel sensitive due to natural tissue inflammation, especially if there was pain or infection before the procedure. This sensitivity or discomfort usually can be controlled with over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve). Most patients can return to their normal activities the next day. Until your root canal procedure is completely finished -- that is to say, the permanent filling is in place and/or the crown, it's wise to minimize chewing on the tooth under repair. This step will help avoid recontamination of the interior of the tooth and also may prevent a fragile tooth from breaking before the tooth can be fully restored. Embed Asset Override As far as oral health care is concerned, brush, floss, and use an antiseptic mouthwash as you regularly would and see your dentist at normally scheduled intervals."
How successful are root canals?,"The root canal procedure is the treatment of choice. The only alternative to a root canal procedure is having the tooth extracted and replaced with a bridge, implant, or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting."
How can you prevent a root canal?,"Embed Asset Override Since some of the reasons why the nerve of a tooth and its pulp become inflamed and infected are due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth and/or large fillings, following good oral hygiene practices (brushing twice a day, flossing at least once a day, and scheduling regular dental visits) may reduce the need for a root canal procedure. Trauma resulting from a sports-related injury can be reduced by wearing a mouth guard."
Why does tooth pulp need to be removed?,"When a tooth's nerve tissue or pulp is damaged, it breaks down and bacteria begin to multiply within the pulp chamber. The bacteria and other decayed debris can cause an infection or abscessed tooth. An abscess is a pus-filled pocket that forms at the end of the roots of the tooth. An abscess occurs when the infection spreads all the way past the ends of the roots of the tooth. In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause: Embed Asset Override Swelling that may spread to other areas of the face, neck, or head Bone loss around the tip of the root Drainage problems extending outward from the root. A hole can occur through the side of the tooth with drainage into the gums or through the cheek with drainage into the skin."
What does a root canal require?,"A root canal requires one or more office visits and can be performed by a dentist or endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist who specializes in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and injuries of the human dental pulp or the nerve of the tooth. The choice of which type of dentist to use depends to some degree on the difficulty of the root canal procedure needed in your particular tooth and the general dentist's comfort level in working on your tooth. Your dentist will discuss who might be best suited to perform the work in your particular case."
What are potential complications after a root canal?,"Despite your dentist's best efforts to clean and seal a tooth, new infections might emerge after a root canal. Among the likely reasons for this include: Embed Asset Override More than the normally anticipated number of root canals in a tooth (leaving one of them uncleaned) An undetected crack in the root of a tooth A defective or inadequate dental restoration that has allowed bacteria to get past the restoration into the inner aspects of the tooth and recontaminate the area A breakdown of the inner sealing material over time, allowing bacteria to recontaminate the inner aspects of the tooth Sometimes retreatment can be successful, other times endodontic surgery must be tried in order to save the tooth."
What are alternatives to a root canal?,"The only alternative to a root canal procedure is having the tooth extracted and replaced with a bridge, implant, or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting. These alternatives not only are more expensive than a root canal procedure but require more treatment time and additional procedures to adjacent teeth and supporting tissues."
How is the tooth filled in a root canal?,"If the root canal is not completed on the same day, a temporary filling is placed in the exterior hole in the tooth to keep out contaminants like saliva and food between appointments. At the next appointment, to fill the interior of the tooth, a sealer paste and a rubber compound called gutta percha is placed into the tooth's root canal. To fill the exterior access hole created at the beginning of treatment, a filling is placed."
What damages a tooth's nerve and pulp in the first place?,"A tooth's nerve and pulp can become irritated, inflamed, and infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth, and/or large fillings, a crack or chip in the tooth, or trauma to the face."
What is a root canal?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form. "" Root canal"" is the term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal. The tooth's nerve lies within the root canal."
What is the cost of a root canal?,"A ballpark estimate for the root canal treatment itself (not including a dental restoration following the procedure) performed by a general dentist could range from $500 to $1,000 for an incisor and $800 to $1,500 for a molar. The fees charged by endodontists could be up to 50% higher."
What findings point to further tests in a physical exam and history for Crohn's disease?,"You'll probably go through a combination of exams, lab tests, and imaging studies with these goals in mind: Rule out other health problems Make a clear diagnosis of Crohn's disease Find out exactly which part of the digestive tract is affected Your doctor will begin by gathering information about your health and your family health history. She'll do a physical exam and look for symptoms of Crohn's that usually include: Belly pain and cramps Blood in your poop Diarrhea Drainage from a painful sore near your anus Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Mouth sores Urgent bowel movements Weight loss Your doctor may request lab tests in order to look for problems that might be linked to Crohn's disease."
How are lab tests used to diagnose Crohn's disease?,"She'll do a physical exam and look for symptoms of Crohn's that usually include: Belly pain and cramps Blood in your poop Diarrhea Drainage from a painful sore near your anus Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Mouth sores Urgent bowel movements Weight loss Your doctor may request lab tests in order to look for problems that might be linked to Crohn's disease. These tests check for signs of infection, inflammation, internal bleeding, and low levels of substances such as iron, protein, or minerals."
How is barium given in the diagnosis for Crohn's disease?,"When barium fluid is given by mouth, it is called an upper GI series. When barium fluid is placed in the rectum, it is called a barium enema. The barium fluid flows through your intestines and looks white on X-ray film. This makes it easier to view problem areas. With a barium X-ray, your doctor may be able to see ulcers, narrowed areas of the intestine, abnormal connections between organs, known as fistulae, or other problems."
How do you know if you have Crohn's disease?,"There isn't any single test that can diagnose Crohn's disease. This condition has many symptoms that are the same as those for other health problems. To make a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, your doctor is likely to gather information from multiple sources."
What imaging studies are used to diagnose Crohn's disease?,"If barium X-rays show some sign of disease, your doctor may request other X-rays or imaging studies."
How can imaging studies help with diagnosing Crohn's disease?,"Crohn's disease may appear anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. X-rays and other images can help identify the severity and location of Crohn's disease."
How does a video capsule endoscopy help with diagnosing Crohn's disease?,"Video capsule endoscopy: For video capsule endoscopy, you swallow a small capsule or pill that holds a miniature video camera. As it travels through your small intestine, it sends images of the lining to a receiver you wear on a belt around your waist. The doctor downloads the images and reviews them on a computer. They can provide detailed information about early, mild problems associated with Crohn's disease. This technique may be especially helpful if you have symptoms of Crohn's disease that can't be seen by other small bowel tests."
When do you need other tests after your barium X-ray for Crohn's disease?,"If barium X-rays show some sign of disease, your doctor may request other X-rays or imaging studies. These X-rays can help identify exactly how much of your digestive tract is affected by Crohn's disease."
What two parts are in a pacemaker?,"The pacemaker has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The pulse generator houses the battery and a tiny computer, and resides just under the skin of the chest. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. They send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle, as well as sense the heart's electrical activity. Each impulse causes the heart to contract. The pacemaker may have one to three leads, depending on the type of pacemaker needed to treat your heart problem."
What will the temporary ID card of your pacemaker tell you?,"Call your doctor if you notice: Increased drainage, bleeding, or oozing from the insertion site Increased opening of the incision Redness around the site Warmth along the site Increased body temperature (fever or chills) Your pacemaker settings will be checked before you leave the hospital. You will receive a temporary ID card that tells you: The type of pacemaker and leads you have. The date of the pacemaker implant. The name of the doctor who implanted the pacemaker. Within three months, you will receive a permanent card from the pacemaker company. Carry this card with you at all times in case you need medical attention at another hospital."
What are the different types of pacemakers?,"There are different types of pacemakers: Single-chamber pacemakers use one lead in the upper chamber (atria) or lower chamber (ventricles) of the right side of the heart. Dual-chamber pacemakers use one lead in the right atrium and one lead in the right ventricle of your heart. Biventricular pacemakers use three leads: one placed in the right atrium, one placed in the right ventricle, and one placed in the left ventricle (via the coronary sinus vein)."
What should I do after the pacemaker procedure?,"Do not lift objects that weigh more than 10 pounds. Do not hold your arm above shoulder level for three weeks. Avoid activities that require pushing or pulling heavy objects, such as shoveling the snow or mowing the lawn. Stop any activity before you become overtired. Avoid golfing, tennis, and swimming for 6 weeks after the procedure. Try to walk as much as possible for exercise. Ask your doctor when you can resume more strenuous activities. Your doctor will tell you when you can go back to work, usually within a week after you go home. If you have the flexibility at your job, ease back to your regular works schedule."
What happens after the pacemaker procedure?,You may be admitted to the hospital overnight. The nurses will monitor your heart rate and rhythm.
How long will my pacemaker last?,"Pacemakers may last five to 10 years and sometimes longer, depending on how often they are used. When the battery becomes low, it will need to be changed."
What happens during the pacemaker procedure?,"The endocardial pacemaker implant takes about one to five hours to perform. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous line ( IV) into your arm or hand. This is so you may receive medications and fluids during the procedure. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The monitors allow the doctor and nurse to check your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and other measurements during the pacemaker implant. Your left or right side of your chest will be shaved and cleansed with a special soap. Sterile drapes are used to cover you from your neck to your feet. A strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. The doctor will numb your skin by injecting a local numbing medication. You will feel a pinching or burning feeling at first. Then, it will become numb. Once this occurs, an incision will be made to insert the pacemaker and leads. You may feel a pulling as the doctor makes a pocket in the tissue under your skin for the pacemaker. You should not feel pain. If you do, tell your nurse. After the pocket is made, the doctor will insert the leads into a vein and guide them into position using the X-ray machine. After the leads are in place, their function is tested to make sure they can increase your heart rate. This is called ""pacing"" and involves delivering small amounts of energy through the leads into the heart muscle. This causes the heart to contract. When your heart rate increases, you may feel your heart is racing or beating faster. It is very important to tell your doctor or nurse any symptoms you feel. Any pain should be reported immediately. After the leads are tested the doctor will connect them to your pacemaker. Your doctor will determine the rate of your pacemaker and other settings. The final pacemaker settings are done after the implant using a special device called a programmer."
How often will I need to see my doctor?,"A complete pacemaker check should be done six weeks after your pacemaker is implanted. This follow-up appointment is critical, because adjustments will be made that will prolong the life of your pacemaker. Then your pacemaker should be checked every three months on the telephone to evaluate battery function. Your nurse will explain how to check your pacemaker using the telephone transmitter. Once or twice a year you will need a more complete exam. If you have a biventricular pacemaker, you may need to visit the doctor's office or hospital more frequently to make sure your device is working properly and the settings do not need to be adjusted."
Should I avoid certain electrical devices with a pacemaker?,"Electric blankets, heating pads, and microwave ovens can be used and will not interfere with the function of your pacemaker. Cell phones should not be placed directly against the chest or on the same side as your pacemaker. You will need to avoid strong electric or magnetic fields, such as some industrial equipment; ham radios; high intensity radio waves (found near large electrical generators, power plants, or radiofrequency transmission towers); and arc resistance welders. Do not undergo any tests that require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). When going through airport security, show your pacemaker card without going through the screening machine because the pacemaker will set off the security alarms. Your doctor or nurse can provide more information about what types of equipment may interfere with your pacemaker. If you have concerns about your job or activities, ask your doctor."
What is pacemaker?,"The normal, healthy heart has its own pacemaker that regulates the rate that the heart beats. However, some hearts don't beat regularly. A pacemaker can sometimes correct the problem. A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm. A pacemaker may also be used to treat fainting spells (syncope), congestive heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Pacemakers are implanted just under the skin of the chest during a minor surgical procedure."
What is remission in migraines?,"If you have them at least 15 days a month, you have chronic migraine. If you have fewer than 15 a month but more than one a year, you have occasional migraine. For some, these attacks can go into either partial or full remission: Partial remission happens when people with chronic migraine suddenly get fewer of them. If you have one 10 days or less a month instead of 15 days, your doctor may say your chronic migraine has gone into remission. Full remission happens when people with occasional migraine go an entire year without one."
What causes remission in migraines?,"Doctors don't know why some people with migraines go into remission. But research shows that certain things can make it more likely: Age: The number of migraine attacks you have each month is likely to drop over time. This is true for people 40 and older. Among women, a drop in hormone levels after menopause may be a factor. Being a man: Men are less likely to have migraines overall. But men who get them are more likely than women to go into remission. Your reaction to touch: Some people who get migraines become so sensitive to touch during an attack that feeling their clothing against their skin or someone lightly brushing against their shoulder is uncomfortable or even painful. If this doesn't happen when you have a migraine, you're more likely to go into remission. Number of headaches per month: Studies show that if you have chronic migraine, you're more likely to go into partial remission if you have fewer attacks. That means closer to 15 a month than to 30."
How can you get heart failure?,"Heart failure usually doesn't sneak up on people, but develops over time and for a number of reasons. It's important to know if you're more likely to get it so you can take the steps to help prevent it. Certain problems can make your heart work harder than it should and weaken the muscle. Some of these are: High blood pressure Diabetes Coronary artery disease Past heart attack Being too overweight Things like drinking too much alcohol, smoking, and using illegal drugs are all known to damage your heart."

And you may not have any of these risk factors and could still develop it."
How is a biopsy done to test for testicular cancer?,"Biopsy: In a few cases, doctors will perform surgery to remove a small piece of the tumor and check it for cancer. That's called a biopsy, and you usually get the result quickly. It's rarely done because there's a chance the procedure could cause the cancer to spread. If your doctor finds a tumor, he'll do more tests to make sure cancer hasn't spread. Those tests might include X-rays or other types of scans."
How is an ultrasound used to detect testicular cancer?,They include: An ultrasound: It uses sound waves to paint a picture of the testicles inside the scrotum.

What are some techniques of ADHD behavioral therapy?,"Specific behavioral therapy techniques include: Positive reinforcement: Reward your child for good behavior. Example: If you finish your homework properly and on time, you can play a video game. Token economy: This combines the reward and consequence ideas. Teachers often use this method by giving out things like star stickers, but the same principle should be used at home, too. Response cost: Unwanted behavior leads to a loss of privileges or rewards. Example: If you don't do your homework, you lose your computer time. Time out: This common consequence is often used when preschoolers use bad behavior. Example: If you hit your sister, you must sit quietly alone for a few minutes."

How does polycythemia vera cause myelofibrosis and leukemia?,"After years of pumping out extra red blood cells, your bone marrow can become so filled with scar tissue that it can't make enough blood cells to meet your body's needs. Doctors call this condition myelofibrosis. It's rare, but abnormal bone marrow cells grow out of control. This can lead to acute myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Again, these problems aren't likely. Your doctor will closely follow your health to make sure you're doing well and staying free of complications."
What are the symptoms of malaria?,"Symptoms for malaria usually start about 10 to 15 days after the infected mosquito bite. Here are some things to keep in mind, though: Because the signs are so similar to cold or flu symptoms, it might be hard to tell what you have at first. Malaria symptoms don't always show up within 2 weeks, especially if it's a P. vivax infection. People who live in areas with lots of malaria cases may become partially immune after being exposed to it throughout their lives. A blood test can confirm whether you have malaria. Along with high fever, shaking chills and sweating, symptoms can include: Throwing up or feeling like you're going to Headache Diarrhea Being very tired (fatigue) Body aches Yellow skin (jaundice) from losing red blood cells Kidney failure Seizure Confusion Malaria can cause you to go into a coma. Children with severe malaria may get anemia, a condition that happens when you lose too many red blood cells. They may also have trouble breathing. In rare cases they can get cerebral malaria, which causes brain damage from swelling."
What is an alanine aminotransferase test?,"The alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) test is a blood test that checks for liver damage. Your doctor can use this test to find out if a disease, drug, or injury has damaged your liver."
Why should your doctor order an alanine aminotransferase test?,"Your doctor might recommend ALT if you have symptoms of liver disease or damage, such as: Stomach pain or swelling Nausea Vomiting Yellow skin or eyes (a condition called jaundice) Weakness Extreme tiredness (fatigue) Dark-colored urine Light-colored poop Itchy skin Here are some reasons you might get this test: You've been exposed to the hepatitis virus. You drink a lot of alcohol. You have a family history of liver disease. You take medicine that's known to cause liver damage. The ALT test can be done as part of a blood panel during a regular exam.

What is the role of the liver relative to an alanine aminotransferase test?,Your liver does a lot of important things for you: It makes a fluid called bile that helps your body digest food. It removes waste products and other toxins from your blood. It produces proteins and cholesterol. Diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis can damage your liver and prevent it from doing its many jobs.
When should you talk to your doctor about an alanine aminotransferase test?,"To find out what type of liver disease you have, your doctor might also test the levels of other enzymes and proteins found in your liver, including: Albumin Alkaline phosphatase Bilirubin Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) Total protein Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand all of your liver test results. Also find out how these results might affect your treatment."
How do you prepare for an alanine aminotransferase test?,You don't need any special preparation for the ALT test. Your doctor might ask you to stop eating or drinking a few hours before the test. Tell your doctor what prescription drugs or supplements you take. Some medicines can affect the results of this test.

Follow up depends on the cause of pain but may require a visit to an ophthalmologist."
When should I see a doctor about my eye sore?,"See a health care provider for persistent pain, eye redness, change in vision, drainage from the eye, rashes around the eye, swelling of the eyelids, or fever."
How can bloodwork help to diagnose transverse myelitis?,"Bloodwork: Your doctor will test your blood for signs of illnesses with similar symptoms, like lupus, HIV, or another form of myelitis. He'll try to find out if transverse myelitis is a sign of a related illness, like MS."
How is transverse myelitis related to multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"Infections: Bacterial infections like Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis Fungal infections of the spinal cord, like aspergillus, blastomyces, coccidioides, and cryptococcus Parasites such as toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, and angtiostrongyloid Viral Infections like varicella zoster, which causes chickenpox and shingles; enterovirus; and West Nile virus Multiple sclerosis ( MS): Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of MS, which destroys myelin in your brain and spinal cord. It can also signal a relapse. If it's early MS, you'll probably have symptoms on one side of your body only."
What happens when you get a spinal tap to help diagnose transverse myelitis?,"Spinal tap: For this test, your doctor puts a needle in between two vertebrae (bones in your back) to take a sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord.

When can the symptoms of transverse myelitis get worse?,"The first symptoms are usually: Pain in your lower back Sharp pain that moves down your legs and arms or around your chest and belly Weakness or paralysis in your legs or arms Sensitivity to touch, to the point where slight fingertip pressure causes pain Numbness or a pins-and-needles feeling in your toes, feet, or legs Muscle spasms Fever Loss of appetite Bladder and bowel control issues Once they start, symptoms can get worse within hours. Most of the time, they peak within 10 days. At that point, about half the people who get transverse myelitis lose control of their legs. Most have some numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in their back, belly, arms, or legs. Almost all lose some bladder control. How much of your body is affected depends on which part of your spinal cord has the problem. The higher it is, the more problems you'll have."
What is the outlook on transverse myelitis?,"About a third of people with transverse myelitis get better and don't have much permanent damage. They can walk normally and have only small lingering issues. Another third have problems walking. They also may have muscle spasms, a less sensitive sense of touch, or trouble controlling their bladder. Continue Reading Below The remaining third are no longer able to walk and need help with many everyday activities. Doctors don't know why transverse myelitis affects some people more than others. They do think that the faster your symptoms show up, the harder it may be for you to recover. Early treatment and physical therapy can help."
How can steroids help with treating transverse myelitis?,Steroids: They'll ease inflammation in your spine. You might get pills or have it put directly into your veins.
How can plasma exchange therapy help treat transverse myelitis?,"Plasma exchange therapy: If steroids don't lower your inflammation, this treatment, also called plasmapheresis, might. The doctor will replace your blood plasma (the liquid part that holds the blood cells). This might get rid of something in it that's causing your immune system to attack your body and keep it from damaging other organs."
How does magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnose transverse myelitis?,"Your doctor will run tests to figure out if you have transverse myelitis or some other condition. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) or computerized tomography ( CT) scan: These tests created detailed images of your insides. They'll show the doctor if something else is affecting your nerves, like a tumor, a slipped disk, or narrowing of the channel that holds your spinal cord."
How does a spinal tap diagnose transverse myelitis?,"Spinal tap: For this test, your doctor puts a needle in between two vertebrae (bones in your back) to take a sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. If it has more disease-fighting white blood cells or certain proteins than it should, you might have an infection."
How is surgery done for larger tumors of skin cancer?,"Larger tumors, lesions in high-risk locations, recurrent tumors, and lesions in cosmetically sensitive areas are removed by a technique called Mohs micrographic surgery. For this technique, the surgeon carefully removes tissue, layer by layer, until cancer-free tissue is reached."
How is surgery done for small skin cancer lesions?,"Small skin cancer lesions may be removed through a variety of techniques, including simple excision (cutting it away), electrodesiccation and curettage (scraping the tumor and then burning the tissue with an electric needle), and cryosurgery (freezing the area with liquid nitrogen)."
What is it like to live with skin cancer?,"Living with skin cancer presents many new challenges for you and for your family and friends. You will probably have many worries about how the cancer will affect you and your ability to ""live a normal life,"" that is, to care for your family and home, to hold your job, and to continue the friendships and activities you enjoy. Many people with a skin cancer diagnosis feel anxious and depressed. Some people feel angry and resentful; others feel helpless and defeated. For most people with skin cancer, talking about their feelings and concerns helps. Your friends and family members can be very supportive. They may be hesitant to offer support until they see how you are coping. Don't wait for them to bring it up. If you want to talk about your concerns, let them know."
What should you do after your advanced cancerous melanoma treatment?,"If you have advanced malignant melanoma, your oncologist may want to see you every few months. These visits may include total body skin exams, regional lymph node checks, and periodic chest X-rays and body scans. Over time, the intervals between follow-up appointments will increase. Eventually these checks may be done only once a year."
What will your doctor talk about regarding skin cancer?,These conditions require the care of a dermatologist or specialist in skin cancers.

Your dermatologist or oncologist should be able to recommend someone."
What are the symptoms of skin cancer?,Skin cancer symptoms depend on the type of skin cancer that has developed.
How can you prevent skin cancer?,"You can reduce your risk of getting skin cancer by following these guidelines: Limit sun exposure. Attempt to avoid the sun's intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Apply sunscreen every day. Use a sunscreen with sun protection factor ( SPF) of at least 30 both before and every 60 to 80 minutes during outdoor exposure. Select products that filter both UVA and UVB light. The label will tell you. If you are likely to sunburn, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid artificial tanning booths. Conduct monthly self-exams."
How do you know if you have a cancerous melanoma related to skin cancer?,"The majority of malignant or cancerous melanomas are brown-to-black pigmented lesions. Other signs of a cancerous melanoma include: A change in size, shape, color, or elevation of a mole The appearance of a new mole during adulthood, or new pain, itching, ulceration, or bleeding of an existing mole The following easy-to-remember guideline, "" ABCDE,"" is useful for identifying malignant melanoma: Asymmetry -- One side of the lesion does not look like the other."
How can you tell if you have skin cancer?,"Skin Self- Exams Monthly skin self-exams improve your chances of finding a skin cancer early, when it has done a minimum of damage to your skin and can be treated easily. Regular self-exams help you recognize any new or changing features. The best time to do a self-exam is right after a shower or bath. Do the self-exam in a bright room; use a full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror. Learn where your moles, birthmarks, and blemishes are, and what they look like. Each time you do a self-exam, check these areas for changes in size, texture, and color, and for ulceration. If you notice any changes, call your primary care provider or dermatologist."

What should doctors check for when looking for skin cancer?,"Have your primary health care provider or a dermatologist check any moles or spots that concern you. See your health care provider to check your skin if you notice any changes in the size, shape, color, or texture of pigmented areas (such as darker or a change in areas of skin or moles)."
What tests do you need if you have malignant melanoma?,"If a biopsy shows that you have malignant melanoma, you may undergo further testing to determine the extent of spread of the disease, if any. This may involve blood tests, a chest X-ray, and other tests as needed."
What do you need to know about skin cancers?,"Here are the basics on skin cancers: The vast majority of skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas. While malignant, these are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. They may be locally disfiguring if not treated early. A small but significant number of skin cancers are malignant melanomas. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that tends to spread to other parts of the body. These cancers may be fatal if not treated early."
How common is skin cancer?,"Almost 91,300 people are expected to be diagnosed with melanoma in the U. S. in 2018, and an estimated 12,000 people will die from some form of skin cancer the same year."
What does a squamous cell carcinoma look like?,"A squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) is commonly a well-defined, red, scaling, thickened bump on sun-exposed skin. It may ulcerate and bleed, and left untreated, may develop into a large mass."
What happens after a biopsy shows you have a malignant melanoma?,"If a biopsy shows that you have malignant melanoma, you may undergo further testing to determine the extent of spread of the disease, if any.

Evolution -- has a mole changed over time?"
What is the outcome of malignant melanoma related to skin cancer?,"In most cases, the outcome of malignant melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor at the time of treatment. Thin lesions are almost always cured by simple surgery alone. Thicker tumors, which usually have been present for some time but have gone undetected, may spread to other organs. Surgery removes the tumor and any local spread, but it cannot remove distant metastasis. Other therapies, such as radiation therapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy, are used to treat the metastatic tumors."
What are skin cancer web links?,"The American Cancer Society also has information about support groups throughout the U. S.

For other valuable information, visit the following Web sites: American Academy of Dermatology American Cancer Society National Cancer Institute Media file 1: Skin cancer."
What do you need to know about cancer?,"Here are the cancer basics: As the cells multiply, they form a mass called a tumor. Tumors are cancerous only if they are malignant. This means that they encroach on and invade neighboring tissues (especially lymph nodes) because of their uncontrolled growth. Tumors may also travel to remote organs via the bloodstream. This process of invading and spreading to other organs is called metastasis. Tumors overwhelm surrounding tissues by invading their space and taking the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive and function."
What does medical treatment for skin cancer entail?,Surgical removal is the mainstay of skin cancer treatment for both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas.
What follow-up treatment do you need if you have advanced malignant melanoma?,"If you have advanced malignant melanoma, your oncologist may want to see you every few months. These visits may include total body skin exams, regional lymph node checks, and periodic chest X-rays and body scans. Over time, the intervals between follow-up appointments will increase. Eventually these checks may be done only once a year."
How can you treat advanced cases of melanoma?,"In advanced cases of melanoma, immune therapies, vaccines, or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments are typically offered as clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies of new therapies to see if they can be tolerated and work better than existing therapies."
How common is skin cancer in the United States?,"Although the number of skin cancers in the U. S. continues to rise, more skin cancers are being caught earlier, when they are easier to treat. Thus, illness and death rates have decreased."
What does a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) look like?,"A basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) usually looks like a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, or shoulders. Others signs include: Small blood vessels may be visible within the tumor. A central depression with crusting and bleeding (ulceration) frequently develops. A BCC often appears as a sore that does not heal."
How can I tell if I have the early stages of skin cancer?,"Many people, especially those who have fair coloring or have had extensive sun exposure, periodically check their entire body for suspicious moles and lesions. Have your primary health care provider or a dermatologist check any moles or spots that concern you. See your health care provider to check your skin if you notice any changes in the size, shape, color, or texture of pigmented areas (such as darker or a change in areas of skin or moles)."
Can skin cancer be cured?,Most skin cancer is cured surgically in the dermatologist's office.
What are examinations like for skin cancer?,"If you think a mole or other skin lesion has turned into skin cancer, your primary care provider will probably refer you to a dermatologist. The dermatologist will examine any moles in question and, in many cases, the entire skin surface. Any lesions that are difficult to identify, or are thought to be skin cancer, may then be checked."
What does a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) look like?,"A squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) is commonly a well-defined, red, scaling, thickened bump on sun-exposed skin. It may ulcerate and bleed, and left untreated, may develop into a large mass."
What are other important causes of skin cancer?,"Other important causes of skin cancer include the following: Use of tanning booths Immunosuppression, or impairment of the immune system, which protects the body from germs or substances that cause an allergic reaction Exposure to unusually high levels of radiation, such as from X-rays Contact with certain chemicals, such as arsenic (miners, sheep shearers, and farmers) and hydrocarbons in tar, oils, and soot (which may cause squamous cell carcinoma) The following people are at the greatest risk of skin cancer: People with fair skin, especially types that freckle, sunburn easily, or become painful in the sun People with light (blond or red) hair and blue or green eyes Those with certain genetic disorders that deplete skin pigment , such as albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum (a disease in which DNA repair mechanisms, especially in response to ultraviolet light, is impaired) People who have already been treated for skin cancer People with numerous moles, unusual moles, or large moles that were present at birth People with close family members who have developed skin cancer People who had at least one severe sunburn early in life People with burns unrelated to sunburn People with indoor occupations and outdoor recreational habits Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are more common in older people."
What does advanced skin cancer treatment entail?,"In advanced cases of melanoma, immune therapies, vaccines, or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments are typically offered as clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies of new therapies to see if they can be tolerated and work better than existing therapies."
How is anti-thyroid medication used for hyperthyroidism?,"After you start using anti-thyroid medications, your symptoms should begin to disappear in about 6-8 weeks. But you'll typically need to keep taking the medication for about a year. At that time, your doctor will check to see if you can stop. You'll need regular checkups once you're off the medicine to make sure your hormone levels stay balanced."
When do you need surgery to treat hyperthyroidism?,Doctors don't usually do surgery unless you're pregnant (and can't take anti-thyroid medicine) or have a large goiter or cancerous nodule.
How is radioactive iodide treatment used for hyperthyroidism?,"Thyroid hormone production can be slowed or stopped completely with: Radioactive iodide treatment Anti-thyroid medication Surgery If your doctor decides that radioactive treatment is best, you'll swallow a tablet or liquid with enough radioactive iodide to damage the cells of your thyroid gland so they can't make hormones. Sometimes you'll need more than one treatment to cut back hormone production to a normal level."
Which products should you avoid if you have thyroid problems?,"Avoid these products: Pseudoephedrine (found in over-the-counter cold remedies) can cause nervousness, insomnia, headache, and high blood pressure. Alkaloids, including caffeine, morphine, and quinine, can raise your blood pressure and heart rate."
How do I know if I have ankylosing spondylitis?,"There is no specific test to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis, but imaging by X-ray and MRI may show evidence of inflammation of the sacroiliac joint between the sacrum (the triangular bone at the lowest part of the back) and the ilium (the bone felt on the upper part of the hip). Some symptoms may include: Inflammatory back pain (gradual in onset, lasting over three months, with stiffness and pain that is worse in the morning and improved with movement) Reduced mobility of the spine Reduced ability to expand the chest Your doctor may order a number of different blood tests that can suggest ankylosing spondylitis. For example, if you have the disorder, you are likely to have an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells settle out of your blood) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (a protein that is usually not in blood at high levels but may be elevated in cases of inflammation)."
How can you clean a minor cut?,"If it's a minor cut or scrape, here's what to do: Clean the Cut First wash your hands with soap and water. Then rinse the cut or scrape with cool water to remove dirt and debris. Hold the area under running water or pour clean water over it from a cup. Use soap to clean the wound. You don't need to use stronger cleaning solutions -- such as hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol -- to treat minor cuts and scrapes, as they may irritate the wound. Cool clean water should be fine for cleaning the wound."
How should you cover a cut or scrape?,"Cover the Cut or Scrape Once the bleeding has stopped and the wound is clean, you should cover it with a sterile bandage or gauze pad and tape. If the cut is small and is in an area that won't get dirty and be rubbed by your clothes, you may decide to leave it uncovered. But for most wounds, it's a good idea to cover them to help prevent infection or reopening the wound. Change the dressing or bandage every day or more often if it gets dirty. Antibiotic ointment can make infection less likely. Using a thin layer of antibiotic ointment before applying the bandage or gauze dressing will help keep cuts and scrapes clean and moist, and help curb scarring."
How can you stop the bleeding of a minor cut or scrape?,"Stop the Bleeding A small amount of blood can help clean out the wound. Smaller cuts and abrasions usually stop bleeding on their own. A cut to the head or hand may bleed more because those areas have a lot of blood vessels. To stop the bleeding, gently apply firm, direct pressure using a clean cloth or gauze. Continue to hold the pressure steadily. Don't raise the cloth or gauze to check on the wound, because that could cause the wound to start bleeding again. If blood seeps through the dressing, just put more on top and keep applying pressure. If the cut is on your hand or arm, you can help slow the bleeding by raising it above your head. If the cut spurts blood or if it doesn't stop bleeding, get medical help right away."
What are the signs of an infection in a cut or scrape?,"Watch for Signs of Infection If the wound isn't healing or you notice any of these signs of infection, call your doctor right away: Redness, swelling, and warmth Increasing pain Pus or drainage from the cut Fever Red streaks around the wound When the Wound Starts to Heal Small cuts and scrapes will form a scab and heal within a few days."
When does a scrape or cut begin to heal?,"Watch for Signs of Infection If the wound isn't healing or you notice any of these signs of infection, call your doctor right away: Redness, swelling, and warmth Increasing pain Pus or drainage from the cut Fever Red streaks around the wound When the Wound Starts to Heal Small cuts and scrapes will form a scab and heal within a few days. The scab helps protect the wound from dirt and germs while new skin grows underneath. Once a scab has formed, you may not need to use a bandage anymore. Although a healing wound or scab will itch, it's best not to scratch or pick at scabs. The scab will fall off on its own without your help, revealing the new skin underneath."
When should you call the doctor about minor cuts or scrapes?,"When to Call the Doctor Most minor cuts and abrasions don't need a doctor's care. But call your doctor if: The wound is on your face. The edges of the cut are jagged or gape open, the cut is deep (1/4 inch or more), or you can see fat or muscle. These are signs that you may need stitches. You can't get all of the dirt or debris out of the wound, or the wound was caused by something very dirty or rusty. You have a puncture wound or a cut and haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years. The wound is from an animal or human bite. The injured area feels numb."
What should you ask your doctor about a sprain or strain?,Make sure you have answers to these questions: What is my injury? What's OK for me to do? What activities should I avoid? What can I safely take for pain and how often? How long will my recovery take? What can I expect during that time? When is it safe to return to full activity? When do I need to get my injury re-evaluated?
What are the different grades of a sprain?,"If you have a sprain, your doctor may mention its âgradeâ: Grade I is stretching of the ligament or a very mild tear, with little or no instability at the joint. Grade II is a more serious but still incomplete tear, with some looseness in the joint. Grade III is a completely torn or ruptured ligament. This is not a broken bone, but can feel like one since it's often impossible to put weight on the joint or use the affected limb because the joint isn't stable."
How long does it take to recover from a sprain or strain?,"The time frame for recovery depends on the severity of the injury and can vary from person to person. It may take just a few days for a slight sprain of an ankle to heal, or it may take months for a knee that needs surgery to reconstruct it. For most mild to moderate sprains and strains, you can expect to regain full mobility within 3 to 8 weeks. More severe injuries can take months for a full recovery."
Who's most likely to get strains?,"Athletes in contact sports, like football, hockey, and boxing, have the biggest chance of strains. Even in noncontact sports like tennis, golf, or rowing, doing the same motions over and over can lead to strains of the hand and forearm."
How can osteoarthritis cause pain in your knees and hips?,"Osteoarthritis often attacks these joints, along with your hands and spine. Your shoulder, elbow, wrist, and ankle can also get arthritis, but this is less common."

Is vasculitis serious?,"Vasculitis can be very serious. In an extreme situation, when a segment of a blood vessel becomes weakened, it may then stretch and bulge (called an aneurysm). The wall of the blood vessel can become so weak that it ruptures and bleeds, possibly causing death. Fortunately, this is a very rare event. If a blood vessel becomes inflamed and narrowed, the blood supply to the area of the body it serves may be partially or completely blocked. If alternate blood vessels (called collateral blood vessels) are not available in sufficient quantity to carry the blood to such sites, the tissue supplied by the affected vessels will die. Because vasculitis can occur in any part of the body, any tissue or organ can be affected."
What is the treatment for vasculitis?,"Treatment of vasculitis depends entirely upon diagnosis and the affected organs. When vasculitis is the result of an allergic reaction, it may go away on its own and not require treatment.

What causes Charcot foot?,"Charcot foot affects people who can't feel anything in their feet and ankles because of nerve damage. That's a common problem for people with diabetes. But other things can cause nerve damage, too, including: Alcohol or drug abuse An infection Spinal cord disease or injury Parkinson's disease HIV Syphilis There's no specific cause for Charcot foot."
How can coenzyme Q10 help with cholesterol or triglycerides?,"This powerful antioxidant can lower bad LDL cholesterol's ability to stick to the blood vessels of mice. However, scientists say that more research is needed to confirm whether it can work in humans. So, what about it does work? If you're taking a statin to lower your cholesterol and having muscle pain as a side effect, there is some proof that coenzyme Q10 can help ease it."
How can niacin help with cholesterol or triglycerides?,"This B vitamin can boost HDL âgood"" cholesterol and lower LDL âbadâ cholesterol and triglycerides -- but only use it if your doctor advises you to. Only prescription-level doses impact cholesterol and triglycerides. Prescription-strength doses have side effects, which is one reason it should be taken under doctor supervision."
How can soy protein supplements help with cholesterol or triglycerides?,Soy can lower total and LDL cholesterol levels a little. Eating soy protein instead of animal protein (like meat and full-fat dairy) will also help.
What opportunistic infections can occur in children with HIV?,"Some of the more common are: Failure to thrive, which means not gaining weight or growing like doctors expect Not having the skills or doing the things doctors expect a child that age would (not reaching developmental milestones) Brain or nervous system problems such as seizures, trouble walking, or doing poorly in school Being sick often with childhood illnesses such as an ear infection, a cold, an upset stomach, or diarrhea As with adults, when an HIV infection advances, kids start to develop infections that rarely affect healthy people but can be deadly for someone whose immune system isn't working well. These ""opportunistic infections"" include: Pneumocystis pneumonia, a fungal infection of the lungs Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) A kind of lung scarring called lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis ( LIP) Oral thrush or severe diaper rash from a yeast infection Children get pretty much the same treatment as adults: a combination of medications called ART (antiretroviral therapy)."

How do I know if I need high blood pressure drugs?,There isn't always a clear answer. A lot depends on how high your blood pressure is and your general health. Your age also plays a role. Learn how you and your doctor can figure out when lifestyle changes are enough and when she needs to pull out the prescription pad.
What will your doctor advise if you have high blood pressure after lifestyle changes?,"At this level, your doctor is likely to prescribe medicine now to get your blood pressure under control."
What do the numbers in a blood pressure reading mean?,"Blood pressure is always shown with a top and bottom number -- like 130/90. The top number tells you the pressure when your heart beats. The bottom number lets you know the pressure between beats. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 and less than 80. If one or both of those numbers is higher, there's too much pressure in your arteries. It's like a tire pumped with too much air."
What conditions can high blood pressure lead to?,"High blood pressure raises your chances of getting a heart attack or stroke. If you have other medical problems -- like high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart disease -- your doctor will be quicker to recommend medication."
How can age affect your risk of side effects from high blood pressure drugs?,"While your odds of heart disease go up as you age, the risks of side effects from blood pressure medications -- like dizziness and falls -- can also get more serious. You need to weigh the benefits and risks. If you're age 80 or older and you have high blood pressure, your doctor may hold off on medication to protect you from side effects."
Can I still exercise if I have a cold?,"It's usually safe to do it as long as you listen to your body. You'll need to watch out for certain risky situations.

And you don't have to run a marathon, either. Moderate activity is all you need. Exercise improves your overall fitness, which can help boost your immune system -- the body's defense against infections."
Can you exercise so much it makes you sick?,"It's not a problem for most of us, but if you're an exercise fiend, make sure you take time for rest and recovery after periods of intense training. Your immune system works best when it isn't stressed. Scientists say athletes who train intensely without building in recovery time are more likely to get colds or flu. When workouts get too strenuous, the number of infection-fighting white blood cells in your body can go down. At the same time, your stress hormone cortisol may go up, which may interfere with the ability of certain immune cells to work right."
How does exercise affect white blood cell count?,"Researchers found that regular walking may lead to a higher number of white blood cells, which fight infections. In another study, researchers found that in 65-year-olds who did regular exercise, the number of T-cells -- a specific type of white blood cell -- was as high as those of people in their 30s."
What are signs that I should stop exercising if I have a cold?,Stop your activity and get emergency medical help if you: Feel chest tightness or pressure Have trouble breathing or get very short of breath Get lightheaded or dizzy Have problems with balance
How much exercise is necessary to reduce illness?,"Some studies show that ""moderate intensity"" exercise may cut down the number of colds you get. That type of activity includes things like a 20- to 30-minute walk every day, going to the gym every other day, or biking with your kids a few times a week. In one study in the American Journal of Medicine, women who walked for a half-hour every day for 1 year had half the number of colds as those who didn't exercise."
What are eosinophils?,"When you have eosinophilic asthma, you have inflammation in your respiratory system caused by cells called eosinophils. Eosinophils are white blood cells. They're part of your body's immune system, and normally, they help you fight disease. One of their jobs is to help cause swelling. That may sound odd, but swelling is one of your body's key tools in fighting germs. But too much swelling can cause problems."
What medications can help with treating eosinophilic asthma?,"Usually, you need to take corticosteroid pills, which can have more side effects than an inhaler. Several biologics are approved to reduce the frequency of eosinophilic asthma attacks. These include: Benralizumab ( Fasenra) Mepolizumab ( Nucala) Reslizumab ( Cinqair) Your respiratory system is your body's system for breathing."
How do I wrap my ankle when it has been sprained?,"RICE stands for ârest, ice, compress, and elevate.â Here's how it works: Rest the ankle (use crutches if needed) Ice the ankle for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 2 days Compress (wrap) the ankle lightly -- not tightly -- with an elastic bandage or ankle brace For the first 48 hours, elevate (raise) the ankle higher than your heart whenever you're lying down Take the compression wrap out of the packaging and unroll it. Place a small section of the cloth just behind your toes and begin to wrap it in a spiral toward your heart. Each layer should cover about half the width of the previous one. Continue wrapping around the foot, heel, and ankle until every bit of skin -- up to several inches above the injury -- is covered."
Is a walking pneumonia contagious?,"It spreads through sneezes or coughs. But it spreads slowly. If you get it, you could be contagious (which means you could spread it to other people) for up to 10 days. Researchers think it takes a lot of close contact with an infected person for you to develop walking pneumonia. Still, there are widespread outbreaks every four to eight years."
Can I get walking pneumonia more than once?,"It's possible. You might have some immunity for a while, but it's unclear how long it lasts. If you do get it again, it may be milder than the first time."
How can I prevent walking pneumonia?,"There is no vaccine for mycoplasma infections, so you can't completely prevent it. There are things you can do, though, to reduce your chances of getting it: Exercise, eat a well-balanced diet, and get enough sleep. Doing these things will help keep your body healthy and better able to resist infection. Wash your hands often. It's one of the best ways to prevent germs from spreading. Don't smoke. Smoking damages the lungs, and damaged lungs are more likely to get infected. Cover your mouth with your sleeve when you cough or sneeze. And ask others to do the same. Coughing and sneezing are the main ways that these infections are spread."
Is obesity and inactivity linked to pancreatic cancer?,"In a study of 88,000 nurses, those who were obese (body mass index higher than 30) were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer.

Five percent to 10% of people with pancreatic cancer have an immediate family member who also had it. Several different genes have been associated with the increased risk, although no ""pancreatic cancer gene"" has yet been identified. Diabetes. People with diabetes are not necessarily more likely to get pancreatic cancer but the two have been linked. Smoking. Cigarette smoking is well known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. The more a person smokes, the higher the risk. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk returns to about that of someone who never smoked. Obesity and inactivity. In a study of 88,000 nurses, those who were obese (body mass index higher than 30) were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Those who exercised frequently were about half as likely to get pancreatic cancer, compared to those who did not exercise at all. Pancreatic cysts and chronic pancreatitis. People who have one or both of these are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Diet. A diet high in fat and meat (especially smoked or processed meat) has been linked to pancreatic cancer in animal studies. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables decreased pancreatic cancer risk in other studies. Still other studies suggest there's no identifiable link between diet and pancreatic cancer. Lycopene and selenium. Studies have shown low levels of these nutrients in some people who developed pancreatic cancer. That's not proof that low levels of lycopene and selenium cause pancreatic cancer, though. Any diet that includes lean meat and red or yellow vegetables should provide adequate lycopene and selenium."
What are the chances of developing pancreatic cancer?,About one in 76 people will develop pancreatic cancer. This represents the average risk of the condition.

Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables decreased pancreatic cancer risk in other studies. Still other studies suggest there's no identifiable link between diet and pancreatic cancer.
How does DNA damage lead to pancreatic cancer?,"No one knows exactly how the process of DNA damage leading to pancreatic cancer occurs. Analyzing pancreatic cancers removed by surgery shows certain mutations that occur in nearly all cases, and others that vary between people. Some of these mutations occur randomly. Others occur in response to things we do or experience in the environment. Some mutations may be inherited. When enough mutations accumulate, a cell becomes malignant and a tumor begins to grow."
Can smoking cause pancreatic cancer?,"Cigarette smoking is well known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. The more a person smokes, the higher the risk. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk returns to about that of someone who never smoked."
What questions can you ask your doctor about acromegaly?,"If you find out you have acromegaly, you'll probably have a lot of questions. You may want to start by asking your doctor: What is acromegaly? What is causing my acromegaly? What treatment do you recommend? How will treatment change my symptoms? What will success look like? What are the side effects? How many other people with acromegaly have you treated? Am I likely to get this again?"
Which medicines can treat acromegaly?,"Your doctor may recommend taking one of these medicines after surgery to help control or cure the disease and bring hormone levels back to normal: Somatostatin analogs (lanreotide or octreotide) Growth hormone receptor antagonists (pegvisomant) Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine) Those drugs either lower the level of growth hormone in your blood or block the effects it has on your body."
How does surgery treat acromegaly?,"There are three ways to treat acromegaly: Surgery Medicine Radiation Surgery is often the first treatment for people with large tumors affecting vital areas, especially if they are pressing on nerves that harm your vision.

If your child has diarrhea and isn't vomiting, you can offer small amounts of these drinks often until he starts to make normal amounts of urine again."
Is water enough to rehydrate my body?,"Water is just part of the answer. It rehydrates the body. But you'll still need the salts. If you have diarrhea or if you're vomiting, most experts recommend drinking rehydration solutions -- special fluids that give your body salt and water.

Make sure you get your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. Eat a proper diet. Get moderate exercise, such as walking, 30 minutes daily. Take the medication your doctor prescribes. For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease, the most important treatment is to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes."
What is the leading cause of kidney disease?,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a leading cause of kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels and filters in the kidney, making removal of waste from the body difficult. Once a person is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, dialysis -- a blood-cleansing process -- or kidney transplantation are necessary."
How is kidney disease diagnosed?,"The symptoms of kidney disease include: High/worsening blood pressure Decrease in amount of urine or difficulty urinating Edema (fluid retention), especially in the lower legs A need to urinate more often, especially at night As with high blood pressure, you may not realize that you have kidney disease.

How often should men have sex or ejaculate to help prevent prostate cancer?,"The exact number of times didn't matter. Basically, the more men ejaculated in a month, the less likely they were to get prostate cancer. Why might ejaculation help prostate health? Experts aren't sure. Some believe that it can flush out harmful chemicals that might build up in semen. While research is promising, there's still a lot scientists need to learn. Some things to consider: There's no proof that ejaculating more actually causes lower chances of prostate cancer. For now, doctors just know they're connected. It may be that men who do it more tend to have other healthy habits that are lowering their odds."

Ask you to bend your knees and to place your feet in holders called stirrups Perform the speculum exam. During the exam, a device called a speculum will be inserted into the vagina. The speculum is opened to widen the vagina so that the vagina and cervix can be seen. Perform a Pap smear. Your doctor will use a plastic spatula and small brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix ( A sample of fluid also may be taken from the vagina to test for infection.) Remove the speculum. Perform a bimanual exam. Your doctor will place two fingers inside the vagina and uses the other hand to gently press down on the area he or she is feeling.

What are the signs of early puberty?,"It's the timing that's different. Signs include: In girls Breast development (which is often the first sign) Menstruation (typically not until two to three years after the earlier symptoms start) In boys Growth of the testicles, penis, and scrotum A deepening voice (usually late signs of puberty) Growth spurts are another sign of early puberty in both boys and girls."
How early does puberty happen?,"Many experts say that, on average, puberty is starting earlier in the U. S. than it did in the past. The average age of menstruation has stayed roughly the same. Yet studies suggest that early signs -- like breast development -- are happening a year earlier than they did decades ago."
What causes central precocious puberty?,"Underlying causes are equally common in boys and children under age 6, especially if puberty is advancing rapidly. They can include: Tumors and other growths, which are often benign Brain injury, either from surgery or a blow to the head, that affects hormonal balances Inflammation of the brain, sometimes from an infection That probably looks like a worrisome list. Just remember that only in a small number of cases in boys is central precocious puberty caused by a medical problem. In girls, it is extremely rare for a medical problem to be the cause."
What are the different types of early puberty?,"There are two types of precocious puberty, central and peripheral. Central precocious puberty is the more common type. The process is identical to normal puberty, but happens early. The pituitary gland is prompted to produce hormones, called gonadotropins. These hormones in turn stimulate the testicles or ovaries to make other hormones, testosterone or estrogen. It's these sex hormones that cause the changes of puberty, like breast development in girls. Peripheral precocious puberty or precocious pseudo-puberty is a different condition. It's also rarer. The hormones estrogen and testosterone trigger the symptoms. But the brain and pituitary gland are not involved. It's usually a local problem with the ovaries, testicles, adrenal gland, or a severely underactive thyroid gland."
What factors are related to early puberty?,"While they aren't necessarily causes, a number of factors seem to be related to early puberty. They include: Gender. Girls are 10 times as likely to have central precocious puberty as boys. Genetics. Occasionally, precocious puberty can be triggered by genetic mutations that trigger the release of sex hormones. Most often these children have a parent or sibling with similar genetic abnormalities. Race. Researchers don't know why, but on average, African- American girls seem to start puberty about a year earlier than white girls. Some experts say that puberty should only be considered early in African- American girls if it happens before age 6. International adoption. One study showed that children who are adopted from overseas are 10-20 times more likely to develop precocious puberty. Again, experts aren't sure why, but the uncertainty of the exact ages of the adopted children might bias the study results. Obesity. A number of studies have shown an association between obesity in young girls and an increased risk of precocious puberty. However, researchers don't know how direct the link is. Obesity does not seem to be connected to early puberty in boys."

Who is at risk for prehypertension?,"Nearly half of all adults older than age 18 have prehypertension or hypertension, as measured by average of two or more readings at two or more doctor's visits. According to the American Heart Association, 59 million people in the U. S. have prehypertension. People with prehypertension may have a greater risk for other cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk factors. These risk factors -- such as high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes -- are seen more in people with prehypertension than in those with normal blood pressure."
Is prehypertension a result of aging?,"You may wonder if high blood pressure happens with aging, but experts say no. Some populations across the globe have minimal rise in blood pressure with aging. In some parts of Mexico, the South Pacific, and other parts of the world, people have very low salt intake. In these areas, the age-related rise in blood pressure is small compared with the U. S. Prehypertension is a warning sign."
How can rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) affect your life?,"People who have the condition sometimes work hard to make everyone like and admire them. Or they might stop trying and stay out of any situation where they might get hurt. This social withdrawal can look like social phobia, which is a serious fear of being embarrassed in public. RSD can affect relationships with family, friends, or a romantic partner. The belief that you're being rejected can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you act differently toward the person you think has rejected you, they may begin to do so for real."
How do you know if your rheumatoid arthritis (RA) doctor is right for you?,"You'll want to see a rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in arthritis and other joint and muscle problems.

What causes cardiac cachexia?,Doctors are not exactly sure what causes cardiac cachexia. It involves many different body systems. Some experts think it may happen when there's an imbalance in the way your body's nervous system tells your digestive tract how to break down food.
What parts of the body does cardiac cachexia affect?,"The condition also has serious effects on many parts of the body, including the digestive tract, lungs, and heart, and the body's ability to make blood cells."
What are some ways cardiac cachexia affects the body and causes symptoms?,"But scientists know a few things about how the condition affects the body and causes symptoms: Fluid buildup from congestive heart failure can sometimes make it harder to absorb nutrients from food. Malnutrition keeps the liver from making a protein called albumin, which helps the blood carry important chemicals throughout your body. The condition makes your body use more energy to do basic things, like breathing. So you burn more calories, but at the same time, you can't absorb them from food. Your body breaks down muscle proteins. That leads to symptoms like fatigue."
What are symptoms of cardiac cachexia?,The main symptom of cardiac cachexia is weight loss. You may also feel: Very weak and tired Short of breath Unable to exercise or be active Nauseated Not very hungry Constipation Changes in how food tastes Some of these symptoms make you more likely to lose even more weight.
How is cardiac cachexia diagnosed?,"There's no specific test that can diagnose cardiac cachexia. In most cases, doctors will try to rule out other health problems that may be causing your weight loss. If you've lost more than 5% of your body weight in 6 months without trying, your doctor may test your blood to look for substances linked to cardiac cachexia, like the protein albumin."

By contrast, people who add no salt to their food show virtually no traces of essential hypertension."
What causes high blood pressure?,"The exact causes of high blood pressure are not known, but several things may play a role, including: Smoking Being overweight or obese Lack of physical activity Too much salt in the diet Too much alcohol consumption (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day) Stress Older age Genetics Family history of high blood pressure Chronic kidney disease Adrenal and thyroid disorders Sleep apnea Essential Hypertension In as many as 95% of high blood pressure cases in the U. S., the underlying cause can't be found."
What other factors can raise the risk of having essential hypertension?,"Most people with high blood pressure are ""salt sensitive,"" meaning that anything more than the minimal bodily need for salt is too much for them and increases their blood pressure. Other factors that can raise the risk of having essential hypertension include obesity; diabetes; stress; insufficient intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium; lack of physical activity; and chronic alcohol consumption."
"What is ""normal"" blood pressure?","The top number is called the systolic, and bottom number is called the diastolic.

S., the underlying cause can't be found. This type of high blood pressure is called ""essential hypertension."""
What is secondary hypertension?,"Secondary Hypertension When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. Among the known causes of secondary hypertension, kidney disease ranks highest. Hypertension can also be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause the adrenal glands (small glands that sit atop the kidneys) to secrete excess amounts of the hormones that elevate blood pressure. Birth control pills -- specifically those containing estrogen -- and pregnancy can boost blood pressure, as can medications that constrict blood vessels."
What is blood pressure?,"The heart pumps blood into blood vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body.

What are the different types of thyroid cancer?,"There are four main types of thyroid cancer: Papillary (the most common type) Follicular Medullary Anaplastic If your doctor finds cancer, he'll begin the process of staging."
What are the stages of medullary thyroid cancer?,"The following things apply to everyone who has this type of cancer, no matter their age. Stage I -- The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. It's only in your thyroid. Stage II -- It's larger than 2 centimeters and found only in your thyroid. Or, it's any size but has spread to tissues beyond your thyroid. It hasn't spread to your lymph nodes. Stage III -- It may be smaller or larger than 2 centimeters and may also be in the tissues beyond your thyroid. The cancer is now in the lymph nodes near your voice box and windpipe. Stage IV -- As with follicular and papillary thyroid cancer, stage IV means that the cancer has spread to distant sites in your body, and the letters â A,â â B,â and â Câ indicate where it has gone."
"What are the stages of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, stage IV?","If you are at stage IV, it means the cancer has spread. Your doctor assigns the letters â A,â â Bâ and â Câ to show how far. Stage IVA -- The cancer has spread beyond your thyroid. It now is under your skin, or it affects your larynx, esophagus or trachea. A smaller tumor in more distant lymph nodes is also considered stage IVA. Stage IVB -- The tumor has grown toward your spine or into nearby large blood vessels, like the carotid arteries. These carry blood to your brain, face, and neck. It might have also spread to your lymph nodes. Stage IVC -- The cancer has spread beyond the thyroid, and to distant sites of the body. It may be in your lungs, bones, and lymph nodes."
What is the TNM staging system for thyroid cancer?,"The American Joint Committee on Cancer created the system that's most often used to describe the stages of thyroid cancer. It's called the â TNMâ system, and it focuses on these three things: T -- How big is the main tumor, and has it spread to other areas of the body? N -- Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? ( These are bean-shaped cells that help your body fight infection). M -- Has the cancer spread, or metastasized, to other areas of the body or organs, namely the lungs, liver, and bones?"
What are the main types of thyroid cancer?,"The thyroid is a gland at the base of your throat. It makes hormones that help your body work properly. There are four main types of thyroid cancer: Papillary (the most common type) Follicular Medullary Anaplastic If your doctor finds cancer, he'll begin the process of staging. He'll run tests to see if it has spread to other parts of your body."
What are the stages of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer in patients under age 45?,"Here's what each stage of thyroid cancer means, grouped by types: Stage I -- The tumor can be any size. It may have spread nearby tissues or nearby lymph nodes. But it hasn't spread to other parts of the body. Stage II -- The tumor is any size. Cancer may have spread to your lymph nodes. It also has spread to other parts of your body, like your lungs or bones."
How does the body clear clots?,"When your body senses that you've healed, it calls on a protein called plasmin. Here's the clever part: Plasmin is actually built into the clot itself. It's there the whole time, but it's turned off. It just hangs out and waits. To turn it on, your body releases a substance known as an activator. It wakes up plasmin and tells it to get to work tearing things down. That mainly means breaking up the mesh-like structure that helps the clot work so well."
What happens if your tests show that you have invasive ductal carcinoma?,"To diagnose cancer, you'll get a biopsy to collect cells for analysis. The doctor will remove a bit of tissue to look at under a microscope. They can make a diagnosis from the biopsy results."

There are two types: Invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) Ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), also called intraductal carcinoma The symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments for each are different."
What can ductal carcinoma in situ lead do?,"Even though it's noninvasive, it can lead to invasive cancer. It's important that women with the disease get treatment. Research shows that the risk of getting invasive cancer is low if you've been treated for DCIS. If it isn't treated, 30% to 50% if women with DCIS will get invasive cancer. The invasive cancer usually develops in the same breast and in the same area as where the DCIS happened."

What are the symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"They include: Obesity An apple-shaped body Excessive or thinning hair Acne Menstrual irregularity PCOS is associated with: Higher levels of circulating male hormones Insulin resistance Carbohydrate intolerance -- conditions that make you prone to gaining weight Low levels of HDL -- ''good'' -- cholesterol Elevated triglycerides High LDL -- ''bad'' -- cholesterol Obesity High blood pressure As women with PCOS age, the presence of these risk factors increases their risk for heart disease."
How can women know if their hormone levels are too high or too low?,"Your doctor can do a physical examination and assess your health situation and symptoms to determine if further laboratory tests are needed to check hormone levels. Those tests may be important if you have a health condition such as PCOS or have stopped menstruating because of excessive athletic training or anorexia nervosa. If the tests show abnormal levels of hormones, your doctor can prescribe effective treatment."

How do I get infected with E. coli?,"You can become infected when you swallow even a small amount of E. coli bacteria. Among the ways this can happen: Ground meat: You eat ground meat that carries E. coli, and the meat wasn't cooked enough to kill the bacteria. When meat is processed, sometimes bacteria from the animals' intestines make their way into the meat. This happens more with ground meat because it comes from more than one animal. Untreated milk: You drink unpasteurized milk, which hasn't been heated to kill bacteria. E. coli can get into the milk from the cow's udder or from milking equipment. Vegetables and fruit: You might eat fresh vegetables or fruit that's been tainted by water that has the bacteria. This happens most often when manure from nearby animals mixes with the water supply. Other foods and beverages: You might also get E. coli from unpasteurized fruit juices and yogurt and cheese made from raw milk. Water: You swallow water that contains E. coli, perhaps while swimming in a pool, lake, or pond. Other people: You might get E. coli from another person who has it, such as a child. The bacteria can be passed to you if you clean up after an infected person and then don't wash your hands really well before you touch your mouth. Animals: It can be found at petting zoos or animal exhibits at fairs."
How can I prevent E. coli infection?,"After you've used the bathroom or changed a diaper After you've had contact with animals, even your own pets After handling raw meat You can also prevent E. coli infections by being careful about the foods that carry the greatest chance of contamination: Cook hamburgers until they're 160 F inside. Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, and cider. Wash all of your produce before you eat it. Be especially careful to get dirt off leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach. In your kitchen, a couple of simple rules will help keep you safe: Wash: Clean knives, counters, and cutting boards with hot, soapy water after raw meat has touched them. Keep raw and cooked separate: Use different cutting boards for food that you eat raw, such as vegetables and fruit. Don't put cooked meat back on the same plate you used for raw meat without washing the plate first. When you're swimming, try not to swallow the water, whether it's a pool, a lake, or the ocean. It may be tainted."
How can E. coli make me sick?,"While many of us associate E. coli with food poisoning, you can also get pneumonia and urinary tract infections from different types of the bacteria. In fact, 75% to 95% of urinary tract infections are caused by E. coli. Some versions of E. coli make you sick by making a toxin called Shiga. This toxin damages the lining of your intestine. The strains of E. coli that make the toxin are sometimes called STEC, which is short for â Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.â One especially bad strain, O157: H7, can make you very sick. It causes abdominal cramps, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. It is the leading cause of acute kidney failure in children. It can also cause life-threatening symptoms such as: Adult kidney failure Fever Bleeding Confusion Seizures You should get emergency help if you have any of these symptoms."

Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, and cider. Wash all of your produce before you eat it."
How is E. coli infection treated?,"The only way your doctor can know for sure if you have an E. coli infection is to send a sample of your stool to a lab to be analyzed. Fortunately, the infection usually goes away on its own. For some types of E.coli associated with diarrhea, such as the watery travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics can shorten the length of time you have symptoms and might be used in moderately severe cases. But if you have fever or bloody diarrhea or if your doctor suspects Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, antibiotics should not be taken. They can actually increase the production of Shiga toxin and worsen your symptoms. It's important to rest and get plenty of fluids to replace what your body is losing through vomiting or diarrhea. Don't take over-the-counter medications that fight diarrhea. You don't want to slow down your digestive system, because that will delay your body's shedding of the infection."
What food should I eat after E. coli infection?,"When you start to feel better, stick to low-fiber foods at first such as: Crackers Toast Eggs Rice Dairy products and foods that are high in fat or fiber can make your symptoms worse."
What is the link between menopause and osteoporosis?,"Although the drop in estrogen levels during menopause can result in dramatically thinning of bone and increases your risk of osteoporosis, it isn't the sole cause of the disease. Many other factors -- like your genes, some diseases and treatments, eating disorders, excessive exercising and weight loss , smoking, excess alcohol, and deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D -- can play an important role. Remember that men can get osteoporosis too, even though they don't go through menopause."
How does vitamin D help prevent osteoporosis?,"The Institute of Medicine recommends: 600 IU (international units) a day for adults through age 70 800 IU a day for adults ages 70 and older Vitamin D plays a vital role in getting calcium into the bloodstream from the intestines and the kidneys. Without enough vitamin D, a lot of the calcium you take in from food or supplements could pass out of the body as waste."
How much calcium do I need to prevent osteoporosis?,"The amount of calcium you need depends on your age. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following: Adolescents should get 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day. Adults from 19 to 50 years of age should get 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. Adult women over the age of 50 should get 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. Adult men should receive 1,000 milligrams up to age 70 and 1,200 milligrams after age 70."
What are some good first solid foods to feed your baby?,"Single-grain cereals, such as rice, are common first foods, but you don't have to start with these. You can try purees of any healthy food, including meats, vegetables or fruits. Should you start out with vegetables so your baby learns to like them? There's no evidence to support this. Babies have a natural preference for sweets and the order you introduce foods doesn't change that."
Can I add solid foods to my baby's bottle?,"It's an important part of your baby's development to learn how to eat from a spoon and to join in family meal time. If your baby has been diagnosed with reflux, your pediatrician may have you add cereal to the bottle."
How can I prepare my baby to try his first solid food?,"To prepare: Pick a time when your baby is happy and not too hungry, overtired or cranky. Make sure you're not rushed, so that you can enjoy the experience. Choose one food to introduce first. Feed that to her for a few days before introducing the next new food, to check for possible allergic reactions. If you note diarrhea, rashes, or vomiting after introducing a new food, stop offering it and consult your pediatrician. If you offer cereal, make sure it's one made specifically for babies; they're fortified with specific nutrients babies need at this age."
When can my baby start eating solid foods?,"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for about six months, and notes that most babies are ready to start solid foods between four and six months. Here are some signs that your baby is ready: She loses the tongue-thrust reflex that pushes the spoon back out of her mouth. Sheï¿½ï¿½s interested in what you're eating -- making âoohâ sounds as she watches you eat, or trying to grab your fork or slice of bread. She can sit up with good head control in the high chair, although she still needs the support of her body. She can draw in her lower lip to take food from a spoon."
What is a tubular adenoma?,"The most common types of colon polyps doctors remove are a type called tubular adenoma. It can become cancerous, and that danger goes up the bigger the polyps get."
Do colon polyps raise your risk of colon cancer?,"If you have a history of polyps in your colon, you're more likely to get colon cancer. Screening is your best way to prevent that. Doctors generally recommend getting your first colonoscopy at age 50. You may need to start at age 40 or earlier if someone in your family has had serious polyps or colon cancer."
What are symptoms of tubular adenomas?,"You're more likely to get tubular adenomas if you are: 50 or older Obese Male From a family with history of colon polyps A couch potato You may not know you have tubular adenomas until your doctor finds them during a colonoscopy. But you may notice: Bleeding in your bottom Mucus in your poop Frequent diarrhea or constipation Belly cramps Anemia, from losing blood in your poop During a colonoscopy, your doctor inserts a long, flexible tube with a lens into your rectum and slowly threads it into your colon."
How can working around harmful chemicals cause bladder cancer?,"People who work in certain industries (painters, machinists, printers, hairdressers, and truck drivers, among others) may be exposed to harmful chemicals for long periods of time. This can increase their risk of disease."
What is the outlook for people with bladder cancer?,"The 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer is about 77%. That means that about 7 out of 10 people who are diagnosed with the disease will still be alive 5 years later. But that's just an estimate. Your outcome is based on your unique situation. That includes things like your age, overall health, how early the cancer was found, and how well it responds to treatment."
How can chronic bladder inflammation cause bladder cancer?,"If you have bladder infections that keep coming back or another condition that causes your bladder to be irritated for long periods of time, you stand a better chance of getting bladder cancer."
What causes bladder cancer?,"It accounts for just 5% of all new cancers in the U. S. Doctors aren't sure. But they do know that several things increase your risk for the disease. They include: Genetic makeup, race, and family history."
How can genes cause bladder cancer?,"Bladder cancer is most common in white men over age 55. If you or someone in your immediate family (parents or siblings) has had cancer of the bladder or the urinary tract before, you're more likely to get it."
How can smoking cause bladder cancer?,Research shows that smoking is the cause of about 50% of all bladder cancers. Working around harmful chemicals.
Who is at the greatest risk for complications of the flu?,"While anyone can get flu, infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with chronic ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and HIV are at highest risk for flu complications. Despite advances in flu prevention and treatment, the CDC estimates that deaths related to influenza range from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths in the United States each year."
Which flu strains are linked to Reye's syndrome?,"Widespread outbreaks of Reye's syndrome have occurred with influenza type B and also with chickenpox, but other viruses have been implicated. The risk of Reye's syndrome is increased when taking aspirin, so anyone under age 18 should not take aspirin if they have any viral symptoms or are recovering from the flu or any other virus."
What is avian or bird flu?,"Bird flu, or avian influenza, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. Bird flu epidemics have occurred worldwide. Bird flu is a leading contender to be the next pandemic flu bug because it has caused an unprecedented epidemic in poultry and wild birds across Asia and Eastern Europe. Still, no one knows for sure whether this will cause the next human flu pandemic."
How many different types of colds and flus are there and how are they treated?,"More than 100 types of cold viruses are known, and new strains of flu evolve every few years. Since both diseases are viral, antibiotics cannot conquer cold or flu. Remember: Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections."
How is the flu prevented?,"Specific strains of flu can be prevented by a flu vaccine, either a flu shot or nasal spray flu vaccine. In addition, antiviral medications are available to prevent flu. These drugs may help reduce the severity and the duration of flu and are best used within the first 48 hours of the appearance of flu symptoms."
Where do influenza viruses originate and how do they mutate?,"Most influenza viruses that infect humans seem to originate in parts of Asia, where close contact between livestock and people creates a hospitable environment for mutation and transmission of viruses. Swine, or pigs, can catch both avian (meaning from birds, such as poultry) and human forms of a virus and act as hosts for these different viral strains to meet and mutate into new forms. The swine then transmit the new form of the virus to people in the same way in which people infect each other -- by transmitting viruses through droplets in the air that people breathe in."
How does CPAP help treat central sleep apnea?,"With CPAP, patients wear a mask over their nose and/or mouth. An air blower forces air through the nose and/or mouth. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing during sleep. The pressure is constant and continuous. CPAP prevents airway closure while it is being used, but apnea episodes return when CPAP is stopped or is used improperly."
How is central sleep apnea treated?,"Some of these conservative treatments include: Losing weight if necessary, and then maintaining a healthy weight Avoiding the use of alcohol and sleeping pills, as these items make the airway more likely to collapse during sleep Sleeping on your side if you have apneic events when sleeping on your back, possibly using pillows or other devices to keep you in place Using nasal sprays or breathing strips to keep air flowing if you have sinus problems or nasal congestion Avoiding sleep deprivation Another treatment is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP), which is the preferred initial treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnea."
What are the symptoms of central sleep apnea?,"Conditions that may be associated with central sleep apnea include the following: Congestive heart failure Hypothyroid Disease Kidney failure Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) Damage to the brainstem caused by encephalitis, stroke, injury, or other factors The main symptom of CSA is temporary stoppages of breathing while asleep. Although snoring is a very strong symptom of obstructive sleep apnea, snoring is usually not found with central sleep apnea. Symptoms may also include: Being very tired during the day Waking up often during the night Having headaches in the early morning Poor memory and difficulty concentrating Mood problems If you have any of these symptoms of central sleep apnea, or if a family member or bed partner notices that you stop breathing while sleeping, you should talk to your doctor or health care provider."
What is central sleep apnea?,"In CSA, breathing is disrupted regularly during sleep because of the way the brain functions. It is not that you cannot breathe (which is true in obstructive sleep apnea); rather, you do not try to breathe at all. The brain does not tell your muscles to breathe. This type of sleep apnea is usually associated with serious illness, especially an illness in which the lower brainstem -- which controls breathing -- is affected. In infants, central sleep apnea produces pauses in breathing that can last 20 seconds."
What conditions are associated with central sleep apnea?,"Conditions that may be associated with central sleep apnea include the following: Congestive heart failure Hypothyroid Disease Kidney failure Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) Damage to the brainstem caused by encephalitis, stroke, injury, or other factors The main symptom of CSA is temporary stoppages of breathing while asleep."
How is central sleep apnea diagnosed?,"If your doctor suspects you have central sleep apnea, he is likely to perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and recommend a sleep history. The next step will likely be an overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. This test is performed in a sleep lab under the direct supervision of a trained technologist. During the test, the following body functions may be monitored: Electrical activity of the brain Eye movements Muscle activity Heart rate Breathing patterns Air flow Blood oxygen levels After the study is completed, the technologist will tally the number of times that breathing is impaired during sleep and then grade the severity of sleep apnea."
What are the effects of sleep apnea?,"Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems. It can increase the risk for stroke, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure. It may also increase the risk for accidents while working or driving, as some people with sleep apnea may fall asleep during those activities."
Is it too late for me to get better if I have diabetes?,"Maybe you've tried to get there before and got disappointed. Rethink it: Bring your thoughts back to the here and now.

For instance, if you lose a little bit of weight at a time, it can lower your blood sugar levels and blood pressure sooner than you may think."
How can I tackle diabetes if I keep feeling like I have no time to exercise?,"Rethink it: Take it 10 minutes at a time. Tell yourself, â I don't have to do it all at once.â Exercise doesn't have to take a lot of time. Even a little will give you a burst of optimism and energy while it improves your metabolism. Try 10-minute spurts of activity. You won't need to change your clothes. For example, instead of playing solitaire on your phone when you're in a waiting room, ask the attendant if you have time to take a 10-minute walk around the parking lot before your appointment."
What should I do if I can't follow my meal plan for my diabetes?,"Rethink it: Give yourself credit for your good food choices. It could be that you used to overeat all the time, and now you've had balanced meals most days this week."
"As a diabetic, should I get a personal trainer to exercise?","The more you focus on what you can do today, the better."

Can I prevent peripheral artery disease?,"You might get other tests, including: Angiogram, in which your doctor uses a needle to put dye into your bloodstream before taking an X-ray to find blocked arteries Ankle-brachial index, which compares blood pressure in your lower leg and your upper arm Blood tests to check for risk factors like diabetes or high cholesterol Ultrasound to check blood flow and find blocked arteries Some simple things you can do to manage your symptoms and keep peripheral artery disease from getting worse include: Control your cholesterol and blood pressure Eat a healthy diet Exercise Don't smoke You also might need medical treatments including: Angioplasty."
What is immunotherapy?,"Immunotherapy is a treatment option for many people living with advanced lung cancer. It helps your body's immune system better find and destroy cancer cells, even when they try to hide. The breakthrough therapy is helping some people with hard-to-treat cancer feel better and live longer."

What are other cancer treatments besides immunotherapy?,"Other Treatment Options If immunotherapy doesn't work, you and your doctor will discuss other ways to treat your cancer. These include: Chemotherapy Targeted drug treatments Radiation If these options also fail, your doctor may suggest you to take part in a clinical trial."
Can your cancer look worse on a CT scan when it is really getting better from immunotherapy?,"When the Cancer Looks Worse but Isn't Your doctor will order CT scans of your tumor to keep track of it and make sure your treatment is working. Your cancer might look worse on the first CT scan after your start immunotherapy. But it may really be getting better. Doctors call this âpseudoprogression."""
What kinds of immunotherapy side effects should you tell your doctor about?,"Tell your doctor if you have: Cough Pain Trouble breathing Any other symptoms that concern you They may be a sign that your cancer is getting worse, or they may be side effects of treatment."
What is the main way newborns communicate?,"Crying is the main way babies communicate, especially in their early days. The cries can be hard to decode, but you can think about her schedule or surroundings to figure out what's wrong. If it's been 2 hours since she last ate, there's a good chance she's hungry. If she's been up for an hour and a half, she's probably due for a nap. Babies can also get bored or overstimulated."
How often will most newborns want to eat?,"Most newborns will want to eat every 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Their feeding schedule usually depends on if you're breastfeeding or giving your baby formula. Breastfed babies generally eat more often than those on formula, because their tummies digest breast milk faster."
What are the signs that your newborn is sleepy?,"If she stops eating and falls asleep, or turns her head away from the bottle, those are good signs she's had enough."
How often will your newborn sleep?,"New babies often get tired after being awake just an hour or two. The first few weeks, your baby will snooze about 16 hours a day, usually in 2- to 4-hour stretches, any time of day or night. Many will fall asleep while they're eating or sucking, and that's just fine."
How can you tell if your newborn is hungry?,"There are many ways babies can tell you they're hungry. They may make sucking motions, put their hands or fingers in their mouths, or you may notice that your baby turns her head toward you and opens her mouth if you gently stroke her cheek. Babies do cry when they want to eat, but it's usually a late sign of hunger. Try to get your baby to burp during and after her feeding. If she stops eating and falls asleep, or turns her head away from the bottle, those are good signs she's had enough. If she cries toward the end, that may mean she's hungry for more."
What is the right position for newborns to sleep in?,"Always put your child on her back to sleep, on a firm sleep surface, with nothing else in the crib or bassinet -- just a mattress with a tightly fitted sheet. By the end of the first month, newborns start to fit their sleep into longer periods. But it will be a few more months before your baby gets into a predictable pattern of a morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon nap, and a longer stretch of sleep at night."
How can infection cause breathlessness?,"If germs come into your body through your nose and mouth, they can travel to your lungs and cause an infection. This is called pneumonia. Anyone can get it, but you're at higher risk if your immune system is weak, you have a lung disease like asthma, or you smoke. Warning signs: Chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain. You may also bring up thick mucus when you cough."
How can anxiety cause breathlessness?,"When you're stressed or worried, the muscles that help you breathe tighten. This makes you breathe faster than normal. You may feel like you're not getting enough air, which can make you panic and make your breathing even shallower. Warning signs: Sweating, chest pain, feeling faint."
How can cancer can cause breathlessness?,"Some types of cancer cause fluid to build up in the space between your lungs and chest wall. This can make it painful to take a deep breath. Warning signs: Feeling like there's a weight on your chest, coughing, fever. You may also feel rundown and tired. What helps: Your doctor could prescribe a drug that eases swelling or helps your body get rid of extra fluid.

What do your alkaline phosphatase test results mean?,"Higher-than-normal ALP levels for your age and sex may not necessarily mean you have a problem. ( Children and teens naturally have higher levels than adults because their bones are still developing). If your ALP level is high, your doctor may have you take another test, called an ALP isoenzyme test, to determine whether the alkaline phosphatase in your blood is coming from your liver or your bones."
How is an alkaline phosphatase test done?,"Other conditions that can cause problems with your liver include: Liver cancer Cirrhosis Hepatitis Blockage in the bile ducts The test can also spot problems with your bones, including: Cancers that have spread to your bones Paget's disease, which affects how bones grow Issues caused by vitamin D deficiency The lab will need a small amount of blood to perform the test. The person in charge of taking your blood will start by placing a tight elastic band, called a tourniquet, around your upper arm. This makes your veins swell with blood. The lab tech will clean an area of your skin with a germ-killing solution. ( It might be a spot inside your elbow or the back of your hand). You'll feel a small stick when the needle goes into your vein. The blood flows into a small vial attached to the needle. When the test is done, the lab tech will take the tourniquet off, and you'll get a bandage on the spot where the needle went in. It takes only a few minutes."
Do prescription dugs help treat IBS?,"Your doctor may also prescribe drugs to help with diarrhea or constipation if you need more relief. Other things that can help include stress management, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and relaxation training."
How is irritable bowel disease (IBD) treated?,"IBD, on the other hand, is more often treated with drugs that target the inflammation that causes symptoms. These powerful meds generally don't work as a treatment for IBS, which is one reason why it's so important to know which condition you have. And while some people with IBD need surgery to repair the physical damage to their digestive tract, surgery isn't needed for IBS."
Is IBS or IBD related to colorectal cancer?,"Lastly, an inflammatory bowel disease makes you more likely to get colorectal cancer. Irritable bowel syndrome doesn't do that, but you should still keep up with your regularly scheduled screening tests."
Do IBD and IBS share symptoms?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. Plus, they both tend to be diagnosed in young people."
Is counseling helpful in treating IBS?,"Counseling is also helpful, especially if the stress of having the condition starts to get to you, or if you notice you're limiting your social life because you worry about when your symptoms will affect you. A support group is another great resource, because the people there will understand, from personal experience, what it's like to have IBS."
What are symptoms of IBS?,"IBS can also cause constipation, extra gas, nausea, or make you feel like you urgently need to have a bowel movement."
What is another natural alternative for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"Counseling is also helpful, especially if the stress of having the condition starts to get to you, or if you notice you're limiting your social life because you worry about when your symptoms will affect you. A support group is another great resource, because the people there will understand, from personal experience, what it's like to have IBS."
Is irritable bowel disease (IBD) a structural or functional disease?,"IBD is a structural disease. That means there is underlying physical damage that causes your symptoms. Doctors can see chronic inflammation or ulcers when they examine the gut with an X-ray, endoscopy, surgery, or biopsy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases."

Plus, they both tend to be diagnosed in young people. IBS can also cause constipation, extra gas, nausea, or make you feel like you urgently need to have a bowel movement."
How is IBD diagnosed?,"Since it's a structural disease, a doctor needs to find physical damage in your gut to make the diagnosis. To look for inflammation, ulcers, and bleeding, you may get: Tests of your blood and stools A colonoscopy or other imaging tests to look inside your gut, with a biopsy CT scans If you have inflammation and ulcers, your doctor can use these tests to narrow down what form of IBD you have. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types."
What are some harmful consequences of having an inflammatory bowel disease?,"Lastly, an inflammatory bowel disease makes you more likely to get colorectal cancer. Irritable bowel syndrome doesn't do that, but you should still keep up with your regularly scheduled screening tests."
