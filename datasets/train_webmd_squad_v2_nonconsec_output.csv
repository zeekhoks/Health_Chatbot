Second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by remineralizing areas that have started to decay. Using fluoride toothpaste is an important way to ensure that your teeth are reaping the benefits of this dental-friendly mineral. Don't think you can skip fluoride if you live in an area where the water is fluoridated. Studies have shown that using fluoride toothpaste helps increase the concentration of fluoride in the teeth, even in areas with water supplies containing high levels of the mineral.

That babies cry a lot at first. The National Center for shaken baby syndrome calls it PURPLE crying: Peak pattern: At 2-3 months old, babies cry the most. Unpredictable: Crying starts and stops without reason. Resistant to soothing: Nothing stops the crying. Pain-like look on face: When babies cry, they look like they're in pain, even if they're not. Long bouts of crying: Babies can cry for hours at a time. Evening crying: Some babies cry more in the afternoon and evening. That's when you especially need to manage your feelings. Have a plan in place. If you feel pushed beyond your limit, put the baby on his back in a safe place -- or inside your home in a car seat with the baby strapped in on the floor (never leave your little one alone in the car!) -- and step away for a moment. Call someone you trust -- even your neighbor -- who'll listen to your frustrations. As you talk, check on the baby every 5 or 10 minutes. You could also ask someone to watch your baby for half an hour while you take a walk and collect yourself. If you notice your caregiver or another parent struggling, be supportive and suggest a safe place they can take the baby when they need a break. Like babies, sometimes parents and caregivers just need to cry and be comforted. If you suspect someone of shaking a baby, call your local police or the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-4- A- Child (800-422-4453)."

The warmth relaxes the skin of the scrotum, making it easier to feel for anything unusual. Use both hands to examine each testicle. Place your index and middle fingers underneath the testicle and your thumbs on top. Roll the testicle between your thumbs and fingers. ( It's normal for testicles to be different sizes.) As you feel the testicle, you may notice a cord-like structure on top and in back of the testicle. This structure is called the epididymis. It stores and transports sperm. Do not confuse it with a lump. Feel for any lumps. Lumps can be pea-size or larger and are often painless. If you notice a lump, contact your doctor. Also check for any change in size, shape, or consistency of the testes. You should also get a physical exam once a year.

How is treatment-resistant depression diagnosed?,"Sometimes, other conditions or problems can cause similar symptoms. So when you meet with your doctor, he or she will want to: Confirm the diagnosis. Some people who apparently have treatment-resistant depression were misdiagnosed. They never had only depression in the first place. Instead, they have conditions like bipolar disorder (where antidepressants may be less effective than in unipolar depression), or problems with drugs or alcohol that can cause or worsen depression, or a medical condition (such as hypothyroidism) that can cause symptoms of depression, and may have been getting the wrong treatment. When major depressive disorder is accompanied by other medical or psychiatric disorders (such as anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or personality disorders), the depression often is harder to treat, particularly if the additional disorders that are present don't receive their own independent treatment. Make sure you've been using your medicine correctly. Up to half of all people who get prescribed drugs for depression don't take them as recommended. They miss doses or stop taking them because of side effects. Some give up too soon - it can take 4-12 weeks for a medicine to take effect. Sometimes taking a medicine at too low a dose also explains an inadequate response. Check for other causes. Other issues - ranging from thyroid problems to substance abuse - can worsen or cause depression. So can many medicines used to treat common medical problems. Sometimes, switching medicines or treating an underlying condition can resolve a hard-to-treat depression. Life with depression is hard, but treatment-resistant depression can be especially brutal."

What are the main external structures of the female reproductive system?,"The function of the external female reproductive structures (the genitals) is twofold: To enable sperm to enter the body and to protect the internal genital organs from infectious organisms. The main external structures of the female reproductive system include: Labia majora: The labia majora enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. Labia minora: Literally translated as ""small lips,"" the labia minora can be very small or up to 2 inches wide. They lie just inside the labia majora, and surround the openings to the vagina (the canal that joins the lower part of the uterus to the outside of the body) and urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body). Bartholin's glands: These glands are located beside the vaginal opening and produce a fluid (mucus) secretion. Clitoris: The two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect."
What happens during the menstrual cycle?,"If fertilization and/or implantation does not take place, the system is designed to menstruate (the monthly shedding of the uterine lining). There are four major hormones (chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of cells or organs) involved in the menstrual cycle: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone. The ovulatory phase, or ovulation, starts about 14 days after the follicular phase started. The woman is now considered pregnant."
What happens during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?,"The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases: the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase (ovulation), and the luteal phase. Progesterone prepares the uterus for a fertilized egg to implant. If intercourse has taken place and a man's sperm has fertilized the egg (a process called conception), the fertilized egg (embryo) will travel through the fallopian tube to implant in the uterus. The woman is now considered pregnant. If the egg is not fertilized, it passes through the uterus. Not needed to support a pregnancy, the lining of the uterus breaks down and sheds, and the next menstrual period begins."
What happens during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle?,"The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases: the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase (ovulation), and the luteal phase. During this phase, the following events occur: The rise in estrogen from the dominant follicle triggers a surge in the amount of luteinizing hormone that is produced by the brain. This causes the dominant follicle to release its egg from the ovary. As the egg is released (a process called ovulation), it is captured by finger-like projections on the end of the fallopian tubes (fimbriae). The fimbriae sweep the egg into the tube. Also during this phase, there is an increase in the amount and thickness of mucus produced by the cervix (lower part of the uterus). If a woman were to have intercourse during this time, the thick mucus captures the man's sperm, nourishes it, and helps it to move towards the egg for fertilization."
What are the main internal structures of the female reproductive system?,"They lie just inside the labia majora, and surround the openings to the vagina (the canal that joins the lower part of the uterus to the outside of the body) and urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body). The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby. A channel through the cervix allows sperm to enter and menstrual blood to exit. Ovaries: The ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Fallopian tubes: These are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants into the lining of the uterine wall. As the egg is released (a process called ovulation), it is captured by finger-like projections on the end of the fallopian tubes (fimbriae)."

What are symptoms of pneumonic plague?,"This is the most common type. It's the rarest form of the disease. It's deadly without treatment. It's also very contagious because the plague can spread through the air when a person coughs. Symptoms include: Cough, sometimes with blood Trouble breathing Nausea and vomiting For most people, the chances of the plague are low."

What is good self-care when you have complex regional pain syndrome?,"As you work on getting better, these steps may help: Keep up your usual daily routine as much as you can. Get plenty of rest. Don't try to do more than your strength can handle. Look to your family and friends for support. Share with them information about complex regional pain syndrome so they can better understand what you're dealing with. Long-term pain can take a toll on your mind and emotions. They might teach you relaxation or meditation techniques, for instance."
How does complex regional pain syndrome progress?,"Anyone can sprain a wrist or fracture a bone. The condition's main sign is intense pain that affects you all the time. As it does the symptoms get more severe: Up to three months: You feel burning pain, and the affected area is more sensitive to touch. Those are the most common early symptoms. Swelling and joint stiffness usually start next. Three months to a year: Swelling is more lasting, and wrinkles in the skin go away. Pain spreads, and joints get stiffer. A year or more: Skin becomes pale, stretched, and shiny. Pain may lessen. Stiffness may mean that the affected limb won't ever move as well as it used to."
What are symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome?,"Anyone can sprain a wrist or fracture a bone. The condition's main sign is intense pain that affects you all the time. If you have it, you might see or feel some of these in a hand, foot, arm, or leg: Constant burning or throbbing pain Swelling Sensitivity to touch or cold Changes in skin temperature between sweaty and cold Skin that becomes white, mottled, red, or blue Skin that turns thin or shiny Joint stiffness or swelling Nails or hair growing faster than normal Muscle spasms or weakness Difference in temperature between the affected limb and the opposite one ( One may sweat more than the other.) Pain in the opposite limb from the one that was injured Complex regional pain syndrome usually goes through three stages."
What causes complex regional pain syndrome?,"Anyone can sprain a wrist or fracture a bone. Even though complex regional pain syndrome most often appears after an injury, that isn't the only cause. It also can be triggered by an infection, heart attack, stroke, cancer, neck problems, or pressure on a nerve. The condition is a rare disorder. It mainly shows up in people from 20 to 35 years old. And it affects women more often than men. Seniors rarely get it, and very few children do. Almost no one younger than age 5 gets it."
How is complex regional pain syndrome diagnosed?,"But sometimes, an injury may trigger other trouble for no apparent reason. Doctors sometimes divide the disease into two categories: Type 1 happens after an injury that didn't directly affect a nerve. Type 2 follows an injury that harmed a nerve. No single test will show whether you have complex regional pain syndrome. So your doctor will probably start with your symptoms and other clues, such as whether you've had an injury that could have triggered the condition. You may get tests that can rule out other things, such as arthritis. X-rays and other tests of your bones may shed light on the trouble. Your doctor may also want to see whether the ailing limb is warmer than the opposite one or sweats a different amount."
Why is malnutrition possible when you have ulcerative colitis?,"When you get flares, you can get cramping pain and severe diarrhea, which can sometimes alternate with hard bowel movements and constipation. Certain foods may make your symptoms worse. So on top of a lack of appetite that goes along with flare-ups, you may be tempted to cut back on how much you eat in hopes of easing your symptoms. There's a risk you could get dehydrated if the fluid isn't replaced."
Why are folate and folic acid important when you have UC?,"That's in addition to eating a healthy, well-balanced diet. It also plays a role in how your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- works. If you have ulcerative colitis, especially if you need steroids, you may be at risk for having low levels of vitamin D. A good source of vitamin D is dairy foods, but a lot of people with UC cut back on dairy to help them curb symptoms of diarrhea. Those levels can go even lower if you need certain medications. Ask your doctor if you should be taking a folic acid supplement."
What is schisandra and why do people take it?,"It is a well-known herb in traditional Chinese medicine as well as in traditional Russian medicine.

What are the risks of red yeast rice?,"Studies have shown that certain red yeast rice products that contain statin can significantly lower levels of total cholesterol and specifically LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. We do know that some types may be more dangerous than others because of high levels of other substances such as citrinic acid. Experts say that the risks of lovastatin would logically apply to RYRE -- elevation of liver and muscle enzymes, muscle problems, and liver problems. Though red yeast rice extract looks like a promising treatment, more research needs to be done."
What is red yeast rice extract (RYRE) used for and is it safe?,"Red yeast rice may be appealing because it's ""natural,"" but you need to be careful. Experts have not studied it extensively. The ideal dosing and its long-term safety are unclear. It could be dangerous for some people. And because the ingredients of different brands of red yeast rice extract might vary so much, it's hard to make firm statements about its effectiveness or safety. So on one hand, the extract is a traditional remedy that helps lower cholesterol. Different types of fermentation are used."
What is the correct dosage of red yeast rice extract (RYRE)?,The ideal dosing and its long-term safety are unclear. It's been used in China and other Asian countries for centuries as a traditional medicine. Another study showed that taking 1.2 grams per day lowered LDL levels by 26% in just eight weeks.
How is red yeast rice extract (RYRE) related to statins?,"One of the most important ingredients in RYRE is monacolin K. It's also known as lovastatin, the active ingredient in the prescription drug Mevacor. Experts say that the risks of lovastatin would logically apply to RYRE -- elevation of liver and muscle enzymes, muscle problems, and liver problems."
How is radial tunnel syndrome diagnosed?,"Electromyography is a procedure in which electrodes placed into muscles and on the skin measure the health of muscles and the nerve cells that control them, to confirm the diagnosis, identify the area of nerve damage, and determine the severity of the condition. Just as with cubital tunnel syndrome, if you have any of these symptoms, your doctor may be able to diagnose radial tunnel syndrome by physical examination alone. He or she also may order electromyography to confirm the diagnosis, identify the area of nerve damage, and stage the severity of the condition."
What is cubital tunnel syndrome?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Cubital tunnel syndrome and radial tunnel syndrome aren't as familiar as their better-known relative -- carpal tunnel syndrome -- but they also can cause severe pain, numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness in the hands and arms. Cubital tunnel syndrome -- also known as ulnar neuropathy -- is caused by increased pressure on the ulnar nerve, which passes close to the skin's surface in the area of the elbow commonly known as the ""funny bone."""
How can computerized tomography (CT) help with the diagnosis of stroke?,"A hemorrhagic stroke is when you have bleeding in your brain. They may put dye in your vein first to look for an aneurysm, a thin or weak spot on an artery."

Almost 90% of people who have a stroke have this, and it happens when a clot blocks blood flow. Your doctor may put a clot-busting drug called t PA in your arm. You should get it within 3 hours of the stroke. In some situations, you can get it 4.5 hours later. You'll probably have it while you're still in the ER. If you can't have t PA, which is a powerful drug and can cause bleeding, you might take aspirin or another medicine to thin your blood or keep clots from getting bigger. Another option is to remove the clot after you arrive at the hospital. Your doctor will thread a device called a stent up the artery to grab the clot, or take it out with a suction tube. They also can use a tiny, flexible tube called a catheter to send drugs up to your brain and directly to the clot."
What is tartar?,"Even if you take great care of your teeth at home, you still have bacteria in your mouth. They mix with proteins and food byproducts to form a sticky film called dental plaque. This gunk coats your teeth, gets under your gum line, and sticks to fillings or other dental work. Bigger problems arise, however, if plaque stays on your teeth and hardens into tartar. Tartar, also called calculus, forms below and above the gum line. It is rough and porous and can lead to receding gums and gum disease. It must be removed with special tools in the dentist's office."
How do you prevent tartar buildup?,"Tartar can make it harder to brush and floss like you should. Here's how: Brush regularly, twice a day for 2 minutes a time. Studies have found that electronic, or powered, toothbrushes may get rid of plaque better than manual models. Choose tartar-control toothpaste with fluoride. No matter how good you are with a toothbrush, dental floss is the only way to remove plaque between your teeth and keep tartar out of these hard-to-reach areas. Use an antiseptic mouthwash daily to help kill bacteria that cause plaque. Watch your diet. You don't have to give up sweets or between-meals munches. Just be mindful about how often you indulge. Don't smoke."
What problems can tartar cause?,"You know it's important to brush, floss, and rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash to prevent tartar buildup. This can lead to cavities and tooth decay. Any tartar that forms above your gum line could be bad for you. Over time, this might lead to progressive gum disease. The mildest form of gum disease is called gingivitis. The resulting stew can damage the bones and tissues that hold your teeth in place. Also, some studies link the bacteria in gum disease to heart disease and other health problems."

In cervical cancer, it is used most often when the cancer is locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body."
How can oral contraceptives increase the risk of cervical cancer?,"The risk of developing these abnormal changes is associated with infection with human papillomavirus ( HPV). In addition, early sexual contact, multiple sexual partners, and taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) increase the risk of cervical cancer because they lead to greater exposure to HPV. Oral contraceptives (""the pill""), especially if taken longer than five years, may increase the risk for cervical cancer because they reduce the use of condoms."
What is cervical cancer?,"The uterine cervix is the lowest portion of a woman's uterus (womb), connecting the uterus with the vagina. When it is invasive, this cancer affects the deeper tissues of the cervix and may have spread to other parts of the body (metastasis), most notably the lungs, liver, bladder, vagina, and rectum. Cigarette smoking is another risk factor for cervical cancer that can be prevented."
How can cigarette smoking increase the risk of cervical cancer?,"In addition, women who have been diagnosed with HPV are more likely to develop a cervical cancer. The chemicals in cigarette smoke interact with the cells of the cervix, causing precancerous changes that may over time progress to cancer. Cigarette smoking is another risk factor for cervical cancer that can be prevented."
Who is more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer?,"Most women diagnosed with precancerous changes in the cervix are in their 20s and 30s, but the average age of women when they are diagnosed with cervical cancer is the mid 50s. This difference in the age at which precancerous changes are most frequently diagnosed and the age at which cancer is diagnosed highlights the slow progression of this disease and the reason why it can be prevented if adequate steps are taken. For cervical cancer, the survival rate is close to 100% when precancerous or early cancerous changes are found and treated."
When is hysterectomy chosen for precancerous changes of the cervix?,"Cervical cancer begins with abnormal changes in the cervical tissue. In some cases, you may choose to have a hysterectomy for precancerous changes, particularly if abnormal cells are found inside the opening of the cervix or you have severe or recurring dysplasia. This surgery is more likely to be done if you do not plan to have children in the future."
How can quitting smoking decrease your chances of developing cervical cancer?,Cigarette smoking is another risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. Quitting smoking may decrease your chances of developing the disease.
When do cervical cancer occur?,"Precancerous changes Over the years, different terms have been used to refer to abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix. Invasive cancer If abnormal cells spread deeper into the cervix or to other tissues or organs, the disease is then called cervical cancer, invasive cervical cancer, or metastatic cancer. Cervical cancer occurs most often in women aged 40 years or older."

What is a CT scan with contrast?,"A computed tomography ( CT or CAT) scan allows doctors to see inside your body. To help them appear clearly, you may need a special dye called a contrast material. They block the X-rays and appear white on the scan, highlighting blood vessels, organs, or other structures. This is done to help your blood vessels, urinary tract, liver, or gallbladder stand out in the image. But radiation's effect adds up over your lifetime."
How are CT scans done?,"You may also need to wear a hospital gown and remove any metal objects, such as jewelry. A radiology technologist will perform the CT scan. Before the procedure, you may want to ask the doctor or technician if the CT machine's settings have been adjusted for a child."
How do CT scans work?,"You can get a CT scan on any part of your body. A computer uses this information to create a cross-sectional picture. Like one piece in a loaf of bread, this two-dimensional (2 D) scan shows a âsliceâ of the inside of your body. This process is repeated to produce a number of slices. The computer stacks these scans one on top of the other to create a detailed image of your organs, bones, or blood vessels. For example, a surgeon may use this type of scan to look at all sides of a tumor to prepare for an operation."

Why do children with autism have problems with sleep?,"Researchers don't know for sure why autistic children have problems with sleep, but they have several theories. The first has to do with social cues. Another reason children with autism may have trouble falling asleep or awaken in the middle of the night could be an increased sensitivity to outside stimuli, such as touch or sound. Anxiety is another possible condition that could adversely affect sleep."
What is a transtracheal catheter for home oxygen therapy?,"This is a soft plastic tube with two small prongs at one end. They go in your nose, and the tube rests over your ears to hold it in place.

Can diabetes affect sleep?,"Some people with diabetes get too much sleep, while others have problems getting enough sleep. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 63% of American adults do not get enough sleep needed for good health, safety, and optimum performance. There are several causes of sleep problems for people with type 2 diabetes, including obstructive sleep apnea, pain or discomfort, restless legs syndrome, the need to go to the bathroom, and other problems associated with type 2 diabetes. Your doctor will ask you about your sleep patterns, including whether you have trouble falling or staying asleep, are sleepy during the day, have difficulty breathing while asleep (including snoring), have pain in your legs, or move or kick your legs while sleeping."
How are sleep problems diagnosed?,"People who have diabetes often have poor sleep habits, including difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. The results of the sleep study can help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis and prescribe an effective and safe treatment. There are several treatments for sleep problems in people with diabetes, depending on the condition: Sleep Apnea If you are diagnosed with sleep apnea, your doctor may suggest that you lose weight to help you breathe more easily."
How does sleep apnea affect the body?,Sleep Apnea Sleep apnea involves pauses in breathing during sleep. Sleep apnea results in low oxygen levels in the blood because the blockages prevent air from getting to the lungs. The low oxygen levels also affect brain and heart function. Researchers have found a possible link between sleep apnea and the development of diabetes and insulin resistance (the inability of the body to use insulin).
Should I get the flu shot if I have diabetes?,"Check your ketones, if you have type 1 diabetes. Your best strategy is to keep the flu away in the first place. Get a yearly shot or nasal vaccine. The best time for people with diabetes to get vaccinated is September. Ask family members, co-workers, and close friends to get the vaccine, too.

The change typically happens between 10 and 20 years after you're diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. Symptoms get worse at a different rate for each person. In addition, MS treatments don't work as well with this type of MS. About 10% of people with MS have this type. It usually leads to disability earlier than the most common type, relapsing-remitting MS. You may have heard PPMS referred to as progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis ( PRMS), but this terminology is no longer used."
Is multiple sclerosis different for everyone?,"Although nerve damage is always a part of the disease, the pattern is unique for everyone. Symptoms get worse at a different rate for each person."

The most common ones are: Infections Headache Fatigue Depression Joint pain Menstrual problems It's possible for some people to have an allergic reaction to Tysabri. With these safety programs in place, the drug went back on the market. Your risk for PML goes up with the number of doses you take. It's also higher for people who've taken drugs that turn down their immune systems before they use Tysabri. Because of this risk, doctors usually recommend Tysabri only for people who've tried other MS treatments that haven't worked. Besides PML and allergic reactions, other serious side effects include liver damage and serious infections."

What usually causes Chiari malformation?,"Chiari malformations are usually caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord. Due to genetic mutations or a maternal diet that lacked certain nutrients, the indented bony space at the base of the skull is abnormally small. As a result, pressure is placed on the cerebellum. That's the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord."
What are the right and left coronary arteries?,"On the surface of the heart, there are coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle itself. Two major coronary arteries branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta and the left ventricle meet: Right coronary artery supplies the right atrium and right ventricle with blood. It branches into the posterior descending artery, which supplies the bottom portion of the left ventricle and back of the septum with blood. Left main coronary artery branches into the circumflex artery and the left anterior descending artery."
What are tooth sealants?,"The painted on liquid sealant quickly bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth, forming a protective shield over the enamel of each tooth.

Other targeted therapies for HER2-positive positive cancer that may be prescribed include ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla), lapatinib ( Tykerb), neratinib ( Nerlynx), or pertuzumab ( Perjeta), Palbociclib ( Ibrance), ribociclib ( Kisqali), and abemaciclib ( Verzenio) are targeted therapies that block certain proteins called CDKs and slow cancer growth. They are given in certain women who have hormone receptor positive and HER2-negative cancers. A new Class of drugs called PARP inhibitors has been found to help women who are HER2-negative but who have BRCA mutated breast cancer. PARP inhibitors include olaparib ( Lynparza) and talazoparib ( Talzenna) and target a protein that helps cancer cells grow. For postmenopausal women who have HER2-negative breast cancer and have tried other treatments for hormone-receptor positive cancer, the doctor may prescribe alpelisib ( Piqray) along with fulvestrant or everolimus ( Afinitor) along with exemestane. Immunotherapy drugs stimulate your immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. In women with advanced hormone receptor negative and HER2-negative breast cancer the immunotherapy drug atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) is sometimes given in combination with the chemotherapy paclitzxel ( Abraxane). Atezolizumab blocks a protein called PD- L1."
How can clinical trials help with stage IV breast cancer?,These medicines are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. A clinical trial may give you access to cutting-edge treatments. Talk to your doctor to find out more about them.
How is chemotherapy used to treat stage IV breast cancer?,"How is this treatment going to impact their quality of life? It can slow down the growth of the cancer. It's often used in combination with hormone therapy. You can get chemo several different ways. You may take pills or liquids, but often the drugs are put right into your veins. Depending on the type of treatment, it may be given in cycles that allow your body breaks in between."
How is hormone therapy used to treat stage IV breast cancer?,"It can slow down the growth of the cancer. In these women, medications can prevent the tumor from getting the hormone. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women and aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole ( Arimidex), exemestane ( Aromasin), and letrozole ( Femara) for postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) and toremifene ( Fareston) are drugs that block hormone receptors. These medicines are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. Women who haven't reached menopause may consider having their ovaries removed to stop them from making hormones that help cancer grow. They are given in certain women who have hormone receptor positive and HER2-negative cancers."
Can complementary treatments be used for children with cancer?,"If your child has cancer, you're always looking for ways to ease treatment side effects. For every study that says they help, there's one that says they don't. Meditation and deep breathing are common ways to lower stress in adults and kids with cancer. Acupuncture can help with fatigue, pain and nausea. But there are other techniques that can help with symptoms and may be a lot more fun for your child. A 2016 review of five studies looked at the results of an exercise program for kids with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer. However, yoga may ease side effects after cancer treatment. One study found that a 6-week program helped with fatigue, anxiety, balance, and sleep for kids between 10 and 17."
Is art therapy helpful for children with cancer?,"But there are other techniques that can help with symptoms and may be a lot more fun for your child. It could: Lower anxiety and fear Ease pain Improve communication with her health care team Rebuild self-esteem that she may have lost due to treatment The idea is to take your child's mind off the pain, procedures, or other unpleasant things that go with cancer."
What happens when you have eye allergies?,"The usual suspects -- pollen, dust mites, pet dander, feathers, and other indoor or outdoor allergens -- can set off eye allergy symptoms. It releases histamine, a chemical that causes swelling and inflammation. The blood vessels in your eyes swell and your eyes get red, teary, and itchy."
What do you need to know about eye allergies?,"But your nose isn't the only part of your body that gets hit during an allergy attack. You can also have red, swollen, and itchy eyes. The usual suspects -- pollen, dust mites, pet dander, feathers, and other indoor or outdoor allergens -- can set off eye allergy symptoms. To treat them, find out what triggers them and stay ahead of the symptoms. Eye drops and other medications can bring relief. When you have allergies, your body reacts to things that aren't really harmful, like pollen, dust mites, mold, or pet dander."
How do you use steroid nasal sprays and what are the side effects?,"Use: Gently shake the container. Blow the nose to clear the nostrils. Close (pinch) one nostril, and insert nasal applicator into the other nostril. Press the applicator to release the spray. Side effects: These sprays may cause nasal irritation, nosebleed or sore throat."
What can a chest X-ray show?,"Your doctor uses a chest X-ray to: Look at your chest bones, heart, and lungs See if your pacemaker, defibrillator, or other heart devices are in place To check on any catheters and chest tubes you may have You don't need to do anything to get ready for it. It can show your doctor if you have: Fluid in or around your lungs Enlarged heart Blood vessel problems, such as an aortic aneurysm."
What drugs can treat erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"A number of pharmaceutical companies are researching new treatments for ED, and many new options may be just around the corner. It is currently available in Europe."
What's the treatment for yeast infections in men?,"You're more likely to get a yeast infection when you: Have been taking antibiotics for a long time Have diabetes Are overweight Have a weak immune system (like people who have HIV) Have trouble cleaning yourself You can also get a yeast infection on your penis through sex. This goes on the head of your penis and under your foreskin until your symptoms go away, which could take 7 to 10 days. You'll also need to avoid sex until you're better. If itching is a problem, your doctor can also give you a corticosteroid (steroid) cream to offer some relief. If an antifungal or corticosteroid cream doesn't clear up your infection, let your doctor know. He may refer you to a dermatologist (skin doctor)."
What is hemophilia B?,"The bleeding can happen both on the surface or inside his body. It can be serious. With the right treatment, though, and by avoiding certain risks, your child can have an active life. People with hemophilia don't have enough of a protein that helps blood clot. There are two main types of the condition: A and B. Your child's type depends on which protein, or clotting factor, he lacks. There are 13 of these clotting factors in our blood. With hemophilia B, you don't have enough factor IX. More than half the people with it have a severe case; they have almost no factor IX in their blood. Does he have any other medical concerns? If your child has severe hemophilia, he may need regular treatments to prevent bleeding."
When is hemophilia B often diagnosed?,"The two main symptoms are bleeding for longer than normal, and bruising easily. If it happens, get emergency medical help for any of these signs of bleeding in the brain: Headache Neck pain and stiffness Vomiting Sleepiness Sudden weakness or problems walking In the first 6 months of life, babies don't fall or get hurt often, so an early diagnosis is rare. You may start noticing issues once your baby becomes more active. As he begins to crawl, he may get bumps and raised bruises. There may be bleeding in the joints. Bruising and long-lasting bleeding from even small injuries may cause a doctor to suspect hemophilia."
My treatment for colon cancer is over. When are times to call my doctor?,"If you need to change doctors, you'll have to give your new doctor all the details of your cancer diagnosis and treatment. There are drugs and other treatments to ease these symptoms and keep you feeling as good as possible. Don't wait until a regularly scheduled follow-up appointment if you're having any of these issues -- call your doctor right away: Abdominal pain, weight loss, or blood in your stool Fatigue that gets in the way of your daily life Problems with your bowel movements, bladder, or sexual function Mental changes, like difficulty concentrating, anxiety, depression, or memory loss Trouble sleeping Changes in your family medical history, like relatives who've recently been diagnosed with cancer"
My treatment for colon cancer is over. What should I know about follow-up care?,That means regular check-ups with your oncologist and primary care doctor to help you maintain the progress you've made. He may ask your primary care doctor to take over your follow-up care at some point.
What are the risks of blood doping?,"It regulates the body's production of red blood cells. This thickening forces the heart to work harder than normal to pump blood throughout the body. As a result, blood doping raises the risk of: blood clot heart attack stroke An estimated 20 European cyclists are believed to have died as a result of blood doping over the past 25 years."
What is blood doping?,"In many cases, blood doping increases the amount of hemoglobin in the bloodstream. Hemoglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein in the blood. Illicit blood transfusions are used by athletes to boost performance."
What should someone do if their prostate cancer comes back?,"Together, you and your doctor will decide on the best treatment. If the cancer is contained in your prostate, surgery or a second attempt at radiation is suggested. If you've had a radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy is a good option. If you had radiation, radical prostatectomy might be the best approach. Cryosurgery might also be an option. If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body, hormone therapy might be the most effective treatment. External or IV radiation therapy or bisphosphonate drugs can relieve your bone pain."
What is the staging of prostate cancer based on?,Stage is based on: The size of your tumor How far it has spread The chances of it coming back Matching the right treatment with your stage isn't always cut and dry. Your doctor can then change your treatment.
When should I drink water if I am exercising for my diabetes?,Ask your doctor if you should check it before exercise. Ease into it.
What is the goal of radical prostatectomy?,"Radical prostatectomy can cure prostate cancer in men whose cancer is limited to the prostate. However, prostate cancer cure is only possible from prostatectomy if prostate cancer is limited to the prostate."
What should someone expect after radical prostatectomy?,"The median hospital stay was two days for minimally invasive surgery and three days for open surgery. A urinary catheter is inserted during the surgery, and some men may need to wear the catheter home for a few days to a few weeks. Another catheter inserted through the skin also may need to stay in place for a few days after returning home. Pain after radical prostatectomy can generally be controlled with prescription pain medicines. It can take weeks or months for urinary and sexual function to return to their maximum levels. After radical prostatectomy, regular follow-up is essential to make sure prostate cancer does not return."
What are the different types of radical prostatectomy?,"Surgeons choose from two different approaches to reach and remove the prostate during a radical prostatectomy. One is a traditional approach known as open prostatectomy. The other, more recent approach is minimally invasive. There are two minimally invasive procedures used in radical prostatectomy: laparoscopic prostatectomy and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. During radical prostatectomy, the removed prostate is examined under a microscope to see if prostate cancer has reached the edge of the prostate."
What is radical prostatectomy?,"Surgeons choose from two different approaches to reach and remove the prostate during a radical prostatectomy. However, prostate cancer cure is only possible from prostatectomy if prostate cancer is limited to the prostate."
What is a benefit of undergoing radical prostatectomy?,"Skilled surgeons can usually protect most of these nerves during radical prostatectomy. The younger the man, the higher the chance of maintaining potency after prostatectomy."
What are the benefits to losing more weight if I have type 2 diabetes?,"The good news is you can get the same benefits from doing 10- or 15-minute bite-size workouts as you do from exercising in 30-minute intervals. These changes can motivate you to continue shedding pounds if you need to. Keep adding more minutes of exercise, and more vegetables, too. It's all part of putting yourself in charge of your diabetes."
How can I manage my type 2 diabetes?,Many studies have shown that lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss are the most effective and safest ways to manage type 2 diabetes. You can start small.
What activities can I do if I have type 2 diabetes?,"That's especially important for you, because having diabetes makes heart disease more likely. But everything counts, even fidgeting. Just standing or pacing while talking on the phone can help lower blood pressure and total cholesterol."
How much weight should I lose if I have type 2 diabetes?,"Here are five manageable goals to shoot for: You might see your ideal weight as 30, 40, or more pounds lighter than you are right now. So start by focusing on losing that 5% and keeping it off."
How do you treat an adjustment disorder?,"Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) is the most common treatment for adjustment disorder/stress response syndrome. Therapy helps the person understand how the stressor has affected his or her life. Support groups can also be helpful by allowing the person to discuss his or her concerns and feelings with people who are coping with the same stress. In some cases, short-term medication may be used to help control anxiety symptoms or sleeping problems. Most people with adjustment disorder/stress response syndrome recover completely."
What are symptoms of an adjustment disorder?,"In an adjustment disorder, the reaction to the stressor is greater than what is typical or expected for the situation or event. In addition, the symptoms may cause problems with a person's ability to function; for example, the person may be have trouble with sleep, work, or studying. An adjustment disorder/stress response syndrome can have a wide variety of symptoms that are changes from someone's usual self, which may include: Feeling of hopelessness Sadness Frequent crying Anxiety (nervousness) Worry Headaches or stomachaches Palpitations (an unpleasant sensation of irregular or forceful beating of the heart) Withdrawal or isolation from people and social activities A new pattern of absence from work or school New and uncharacteristic dangerous or destructive behavior, such as fighting, reckless driving, and vandalism Changes in appetite, either loss of appetite, or overeating Problems sleeping Feeling tired or without energy Increase in the use of alcohol or other drugs Symptoms in children and teens tend to be more behavioral in nature, such as skipping school, fighting, or acting out."
How does glucagon work?,"Glucose goes from your liver into your blood to give you energy. Glucagon can tell your liver not to take in too much glucose from the food you eat and to release stored sugar into your blood instead. If your blood sugar dips too low, your pancreas releases glucagon to tell your liver to make more glucose. Glucagon can also play a role in how amino acids (compounds that help make up muscles and tissue in your body) make glucose. And it can break down triglycerides, or fat your body stores, into fuel. Your body needs it to turn blood sugar into fuel. This can raise your blood sugar levels too much after your meals."
How do you treat severe hypoglycemia?,"People with type 1 diabetes are at higher risk for this severe type of hypoglycemia. If you've fainted, someone can give you a shot of the hormone to boost your blood sugar levels."
What helps hypoglycemia?,This can make you feel dizzy or sluggish or even pass out. Glucagon can help with hypoglycemia so you feel right again. Hypoglycemia refers to a blood sugar level that's gotten too low.
How does having diabetes affect glucagon?,"This can change how your body makes glucagon. Usually, food gives your body the sugar and energy it needs. Glucagon levels then go down because your liver doesn't need to make more sugar to fuel your muscles. With diabetes, your pancreas doesn't stop making glucagon when you eat. This can raise your blood sugar levels too much after your meals. But you also can get it if you have type 2 diabetes and take insulin."
How can you treat severe low blood sugar?,"People with type 1 diabetes are at higher risk for this severe type of hypoglycemia. If you've fainted, someone can give you a shot of the hormone to boost your blood sugar levels. Your doctor can prescribe an emergency glucagon kit. This contains the hormone in a powder and a syringe filled with fluid. It will have clear instructions on how to quickly mix and inject the glucagon shot."
How can I stop biting my nails?,"It's a way to cope with these feelings. Coat them with a bad taste. There are special nail polishes with a bitter flavor you can paint on your nails. If gloves won't work for your daily schedule, you can look for stickers made to cover nails -- they can have the same effect. Find your triggers. Notice how you feel or what you're doing when you bite your nails. Find something to fiddle with -- a stress ball, a worry stone, or even a pen to click. Chew gum so your mouth has a job."
Why should I stop biting my nails?,"Nail biting won't typically cause permanent damage. But it definitely has its downsides: It can make your nails grow in weird. It can make you sick. Hands are a hotbed for germs, and nails are their perfect hideout. Notice how you feel or what you're doing when you bite your nails."
What are the types of strokes?,"There are two types of stroke: Ischemic strokeis similar to a heart attack, except it occurs in the blood vessels of the brain. About 80% of all strokes are ischemic. Hemorrhagic (heh-more-raj-ik) strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain breaks or ruptures. The result is blood seeping into the brain tissue, causing damage to brain cells."
What is a stroke?,"These clots block blood flow to the brain's cells. The result is blood seeping into the brain tissue, causing damage to brain cells."
How is Williams syndrome diagnosed?,"Children are slower to walk, talk, and gain new skills compared to other children their age. Your doctor will do an exam and ask about your family medical history. Then the doctor will look for facial features like an upturned nose, wide forehead, and small teeth. An electrocardiogram ( EKG) or ultrasound can check for heart problems. A bladder and kidney ultrasound can check for urinary tract conditions. Your child might get a blood test called FISH, or fluorescence in situ hybridization, to see if any genes are missing. Most people with Williams syndrome will not have the ELN gene. Because these issues can develop over time, doctors will want to see your child regularly."
What is Williams syndrome?,"Children with this syndrome could have problems with their heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other organs. Their nose, mouth, and other facial features may be unique. They sometimes have trouble learning. Children with Williams syndrome will need to see many doctors throughout their lives. But with the right treatment, they can stay healthy and do well in school. Williams syndrome can't be cured, but treatments can help with symptoms and learning problems."
What are possible symptoms of Williams syndrome?,"Children with this syndrome could have problems with their heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other organs. Curved spine, called scoliosis Ear infections Early puberty Farsightedness Hernia High levels of calcium in the blood Hoarse voice Joint and bone problems Kidney problems Urinary tract infections Williams syndrome is usually diagnosed before a child is 4 years old."
What causes Williams syndrome?,"Babies with Williams syndrome are born without certain genes. In a small number of cases, babies inherit the genetic deletion from a parent with the condition, but it is usually a random disorder in the genes. It can also affect a child's ability to learn."
What are treatments for Williams syndrome?,"Many different caregivers can be involved in taking care of your child, including a: Cardiologist -- a doctor who treats heart problems Endocrinologist -- a doctor who treats hormone problems Gastroenterologist -- a doctor who treats gastrointestinal problems Ophthalmologist -- a doctor who treats eye problems Psychologist Speech and language therapist Occupational therapist Physical therapist Some of the treatments your child might need: A diet low in calcium and vitamin D to bring down high calcium levels in the blood Medicine to lower blood pressure Special education, including speech and language therapy Physical therapy Surgery to fix a blood vessel or heart problem Your child might need treatments for other symptoms, too. Williams syndrome can't be cured, but treatments can help with symptoms and learning problems. Every child with Williams syndrome is different. Some can lead a very normal life. Others have more serious health and learning problems. They may need lifelong medical care."
How can Williams syndrome affect the heart and blood vessels?,"Children with this syndrome could have problems with their heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other organs. The aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, may be narrowed. The pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs also may be narrowed. High blood pressure is common. Narrowed arteries don't let as much oxygen-rich blood reach the heart and body. High blood pressure and decreased blood flow can damage the heart."
How are nerve blocks used?,"Therapeutic nerve blocks are used to treat painful conditions. Diagnostic nerve blocks are used to determine sources of pain. Prognostic nerve blocks predict the outcomes of given treatments. Preemptive nerve blocks are meant to prevent subsequent pain from a procedure that can cause problems including phantom limb pain. Nerve blocks can be used, in some cases, to avoid surgery."
How are pancreatic pseudocysts treated?,"The most common cause of a pancreatic pseudocyst is inflammation of the pancreas, called pancreatitis. Here's what you need to know about pseudocysts and their treatment. Although the symptoms of pseudocysts may be different for different people, some of the most common are abdominal pain and bloating. If a pseudocyst is small and not causing serious symptoms, a doctor may want to monitor it with periodic CT scans. If the pseudocyst persists, gets larger, or causes pain, it will require surgical treatment. If not monitored or treated, a pseudocyst can become infected or rupture, causing severe pain, blood loss and abdominal infection."
How is a pancreatic pseudocyst drained without surgery?,"The most common cause of a pancreatic pseudocyst is inflammation of the pancreas, called pancreatitis. Often pseudocysts get better and go away on their own. This can be done by a radiologist or gastroenterologist, a doctor specializing in the digestive system. A radiologist will drain it by inserting a needle guided by computed tomography. A gastroenterologist may drain the pseudocyst through the stomach by creating a small opening between the pseudocyst and the stomach, or by placing a stent into the pancreas during endoscopy. If the stent is placed directly into the pseudocyst then the fluid from the pseudocyst is drained into the intestine through this tube."
How is Provenge used to treat prostate cancer?,"One reason is that cancer cells look a lot to the immune system like normal cells. Another reason is that tumors may give off signals that manipulate the immune system into leaving them alone. Provenge bypasses these problems. The treatment first removes a quantity of dendritic cells from a patient's blood. Dendritic cells show pieces of tumor to immune cells, priming them to attack cells that carry those pieces. The patient's doctor ships the cells to Provenge's manufacturer, Dendreon, which then exposes them to Provenge. Provenge is a molecule made inside genetically engineered insect cells. Once these cells have been exposed to Provenge, they're shipped back to the doctor who infuses them back into the patient. This is done three times in one month. The first infusion primes the immune system. The second and third doses spur an anticancer immune response. Cyrosurgery (also called cryotherapy) may be used in cases of recurrent prostate cancer if the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate."
How are antiandrogens used to treat prostate cancer?,"These drugs work by decreasing testosterone production to very low levels by depleting the pituitary gland of the hormone needed to produce testosterone. Antiandrogens are sometimes used in addition to orchiectomy or LHRH analogs. This is due to the fact that the other forms of hormone therapy remove about 90% of testosterone circulating in the body. Antiandrogens may help block the remaining 10% of circulating testosterone. Using antiandrogens with another form of hormone therapy is called combined androgen blockade ( CAB), or total androgen ablation. Antiandrogens may also be used to combat the symptoms of flare (temporary rise in testosterone that occurs with the use of LHRH agonists). Some doctors prescribe antiandrogens alone rather than with orchiectomy or LHRH analogs. Available antiandrogens include abiraterone acetate ( Zytiga), biclutamide ( Casodex), enzalutamide ( Xtandi),flutamide ( Eulexin), and nilutamide ( Nilandron). Patients take antiandrogens as pills. Diarrhea is the primary side effect when antiandrogens are used as part of combination therapy. Less likely side effects include nausea, liver problems, and fatigue. When antiandrogens are used alone they may cause a reduction in sex drive and impotence."
How is combination radiation and endocrine therapy used to treat prostate cancer?,"For patients with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer, studies show this combination is more effective at slowing the disease than endocrine therapy or radiation therapy alone. Radiation can also come in the form of a monthly intravenous drug called Xofigo. Xofigo is approved for use in men who have advanced prostate cancer that has spread only to the bones. Candidates should have also received therapy designed to lower testosterone. The drug works by binding to minerals within bones to deliver radiation directly to bone tumors. A study of 809 men showed that those taking Xofigo lived an average of 3 months longer than those taking a placebo. Two other similar drugs arestrontium-89 ( Metastron) and samarium-153 ( Quadramet). However, patients who receive combination therapy are more likely to experience treatment-related side effects than patients receiving a single form of hormone therapy."
How are luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists used to treat prostate cancer?,"LHRH antagonists lower testosterone levels more quickly than LHRH analogs. In addition, they don't cause a tumor flare (temporary rise in testosterone levels) as do LHRH analogs. Degarelix ( Firmagon) is a LHRH antagonist used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It has been shown to decrease the progression of disease, but further trials are needed to look at long-term outcomes. It is fairly well tolerated with common side effects being local injection site problems and increased liver enzymes. Xofigo is approved for use in men who have advanced prostate cancer that has spread only to the bones."
How are luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs used to treat prostate cancer?,"Most patients who receive hormonal therapy choose LHRH analogs. These drugs work by decreasing testosterone production to very low levels by depleting the pituitary gland of the hormone needed to produce testosterone. However, before this decrease in testosterone occurs, patients experience a brief and temporary increase in testosterone production and tumor growth. This is due to a transient increase in release of LHRH from the pituitary gland with a resulting stimulation of testosterone production. This phenomenon, called tumor flare, can cause increased symptoms from the prostate cancer that didn't exist before the patient received the therapy. Some doctors prescribe antiandrogens (described below) to combat the symptoms caused by tumor flare. LHRH analogs are administered via injection or small implants placed under the skin. The most commonly used LHRH analogs in the U. S. are leuprolide ( Eligard, Lupron), histrelin ( Vantas), triptorelin ( Trelstar), and goserelin ( Zoladex). Before starting one of these drugs, patients should tell their doctor if they have a history of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or cigarette smoking."
What do studies say about relationships and diabetes?,"Managing your type 2 diabetes is a big part of your life. If you have a partner or a spouse, diabetes becomes a part of their life, too. Studies show that a supportive partner can help you better manage your disease. Both of you should learn about the danger of high and low blood sugar levels, insulin and other medications, the benefits of exercise, and the best diet to keep your blood sugar under control. Consider taking your partner along on your doctors' appointments or to diabetes classes."
What changes to my bedtime routine can help prevent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"They can bring on GERD symptoms, so limit them or cut back completely if you can. Try not to snack or dine at least 2 to 3 hours before you go to sleep. Prop up the head of your bed 6 to 10 inches. You can keep heartburn and other GERD symptoms away if you put your head and chest above your stomach. It helps gravity keep what's in your stomach away from your esophagus. Don't prop your back up with pillows, though, since that may bend your body in a way that puts pressure on your stomach. Instead, use a foam wedge under your mattress, or put blocks of wood under the top legs of the bed."
Do bifocals work to treat presbyopia?,"If you have glasses already, this might be the option for you. They're eyeglasses with two different prescriptions in one lens. The top part corrects for distance vision. The lower section helps you see objects up close. It can work for people with presbyopia who haven't had cataract surgery."
Does stinging nettle help treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?,Stinging nettle root is a common treatment in Europe for symptoms of BPH. More research is needed to show that the treatment is indeed effective.
How does heart disease affect diabetics?,"Heart disease is common in people with diabetes. While all people with diabetes have an increased chance of developing heart disease, the condition is more common in those with type 2 diabetes. The more health risks factors a person has for heart disease, the higher the chances that they will develop heart disease and even die from it."
Do I have heart disease If I have type 2 diabetes?,"In fact, heart disease is the number one cause of death among people with type 2 diabetes. The most common cause of heart disease in a person with diabetes is hardening of thecoronary arteries or atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of cholesterol in the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrition to the heart."
How can you help prevent your child's bedwetting?,"Reduce evening fluid intake. Do not give your child anything to drink in the two hours before bedtime, especially drinks such as tea or sodas that contain caffeine. Have your child go to the bathroom before getting into bed. Instead of focusing on making it through the night dry, help your child understand that it is more important to wake up every night to use the toilet. Make sure the child has easy access to the toilet. The child gets a sticker on the chart for every night of remaining dry. Consider using absorbent pants at night. Some believe that you should avoid using absorbent pants at home because they can interfere with the motivation to wake up and use the toilet. Others argue that absorbent pants help the child feel more independent and confident. Talk to your child's doctor to determine what is best for your child."
How should I give myself insulin?,"To inject insulin, you can use a syringe, pen, or pump. If you use an insulin pump, ask your doctor when you'll need to give yourself an extra amount of insulin (bolus). If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need up to three or four injections daily. People with type 2 diabetes may need just one shot of insulin a day, possibly increasing to three or four injections. There is also a rapid-acting inhaled insulin that you can use before meals only. If you have type 1 diabetes, you must also use long-acting insulin. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of each method. How are you responding to your insulin dose? Have you had any trouble using your insulin syringe, pen, or pump?"
What is my target blood sugar level?,"Your doctor can tell you which type will work best with your diabetes type and blood sugar level. Find out your target blood sugar range before and after meals, as well as at bedtime. For most people with diabetes, the targets are: 70 to 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) before meals Less than 180 mg/d L 2 hours after a meal Ask what to do if your blood sugar doesn't stay within range, and how often you need to have your A1 C level tested."
What questions should I ask my doctor about my blood sugar level?,"Your doctor can tell you which type will work best with your diabetes type and blood sugar level. Find out your target blood sugar range before and after meals, as well as at bedtime. For most people with diabetes, the targets are: 70 to 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) before meals Less than 180 mg/d L 2 hours after a meal Ask what to do if your blood sugar doesn't stay within range, and how often you need to have your A1 C level tested."
What questions should I ask my doctor about other medications and insulin?,Does insulin affect other medicines I take? Are you having any problems with high or low blood sugar?
Why are follow-ups and skin checks necessary after treating Bowen's disease?,You can't always tell by looking at your skin if you have Bowen's disease. You should have regular follow-ups and skin checks with your doctor.
How is Bowen's disease diagnosis confirmed?,"Many other skin conditions can look the same. It can be mistaken for harmless disorders -- like rashes or eczema -- as well as life-threatening ones, including melanoma. Your doctor usually has to take a sample of your skin for testing (biopsy) to confirm it. If you have Bowen's disease, you're at a higher risk for other types of skin cancers, especially if you have a weak immune system from disease or medical treatments."
Can minerals help control blood sugar?,Ongoing studies point to two minerals that may be linked to blood sugar control. That's the first step in deciding whether or not to mix diabetes and dietary supplements.
What are the risks of taking vitamin D?,"At normal doses, vitamin D seems to have few side effects. Too much vitamin D can cause loss of appetite, the need to pee a lot, nausea, and weight loss. High doses of vitamin D can also make you disoriented and lead to bone pain and kidney stones."
How can you get vitamin D?,"Just 10 to 15 minutes of sunlight without sunscreen a couple of times a week usually gives you enough vitamin D.

How does high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol reduce the risk for heart disease?,"As it does, it removes harmful bad cholesterol from where it doesn't belong. High HDL levels reduce the risk for heart disease -- but low levels increase the risk. HDL cholesterol acts as a maintenance crew for the inner walls (endothelium) of blood vessels. Damage to the inner walls is the first step in the process of atherosclerosis, which causes heart attacks and strokes. HDL scrubs the wall clean and keeps it healthy A cholesterol test or lipid panel tells the level of HDL cholesterol."
How does cholesterol travel through the bloodstream?,"Each bit of HDL cholesterol is a microscopic blob that consists of a rim of lipoprotein surrounding a cholesterol center. HDL reduces, reuses, and recycles LDL cholesterol by transporting it to the liver where it can be reprocessed."

The relief usually lasts from several weeks to several months. Your doctor may use imaging technology to help guide the needle into place."
What are the risks of injecting corticosteroid for osteoarthritis (OA)?,"Corticosteroids help fight inflammation -- the heat, redness, pain, and swelling in an injured or inflamed part of the body. Some can be dangerous, such as a greater risk of infection, weight gain, ulcers in your digestive tract and bleeding, osteoporosis, increases in blood pressure and blood glucose levels, and eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma.

Uric acid stones: These kidney stones form due to dehydration and a process called metabolic acidosis in which the balance of acids and bases in your blood gets thrown off. You're only likely to notice low energy and fatigue unless you develop a more serious problem. When Crohn's affects the terminal ileum (where your small intestine meets the large intestine), it can't process bile salts, which help cholesterol dissolve in bile.

Take notice of these early symptoms of heart problems: Coughing more than usual (during or after exercise or a few hours before bedtime) Having a hard time breathing or exercising Tiring easily Pacing before bedtime and having a hard time settling down Increased respiratory rate -- how many breaths per minute More symptoms may develop, as the disease gets worse, including: A swollen belly from fluid buildup in (called ascites) Fainting because of blocked blood flow to the brain Change in tongue or gum color to bluish gray because of poor oxygen flow Weight loss as your dog loses her ability to store healthy fat Your vet will want to know any symptoms you've noticed."
What treatments can help my dog with congestive heart failure?,That's when your dog's heart has trouble pumping blood to the rest of its body. Your dog's treatment depends on what specific heart problem she has and what may be causing it. Your vet may recommend one or more of the following: Medications to help the heart work and correct irregular heartbeats Medications to slow fluid build-up in the lungs Surgery to correct a torn valve or to insert a pacemaker to correct the heart beat A commercial or prescription low-salt diet to help decrease fluid build-up in your dog's body Limited activity or exercise to manage weight without putting too much strain on your dog's heart Your vet may also recommend supplements.
How is congestive heart failure in dogs diagnosed?,"That's when your dog's heart has trouble pumping blood to the rest of its body. He or she will want to know what she eats, what medications and supplements she may be taking, and if she is current on heartworm protection. The vet will listen to your dog's chest and may want to run some tests, including: A blood and urine test to check for any other problems that could be affecting your dog's heart. Ultrasound uses sound waves to look at the size, shape, and movement of the heart. This is taped to your dog’s chest and worn for 24-48 hours to capture heart rhythms and rate."
How do supplements help in treating congestive heart failure in dogs?,"That's when your dog's heart has trouble pumping blood to the rest of its body. Dogs with congestive heart failure may benefit from vitamin B supplements, taurine (an amino acid that supports brain development), or carnitine (an amino acid that helps turn fat into energy). Antioxidants like Coenzyme Q and vitamin E may also help. Make sure to bring your dog for regular visits with your vet and stick with your treatment plan."

When should you get medical help for depression?,"Although very common, depression is often ignored or misdiagnosed and left untreated. Such inattention can be life-threatening; major depression, in particular, has a high suicide rate. If you or a loved one have symptoms of depression, seek help from a qualified health care provider. But if your symptoms get significantly worse or do not improve within four to eight weeks of treatment, ask your health care provider for a referral to a psychiatrist for diagnosis and treatment. Clearly, for more severe symptoms -- and always if you have thoughts about death or hurting yourself or someone else -- you should see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Psychotherapy is an important part of treatment for depression."
Can St. John's Wort treat depression?,"However, to date, studies have not found r TMS to be as effective as ECT. Several studies show that the herb St. John's Wort is as successful at improving symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression as prescription medications, often with fewer side effects. Although it is considered safe, St. John's Wort can be potentially dangerous if taken with other antidepressants (especially SSRIs), including certain medications used for treating HIV, cyclosporine, a drug used in organ transplant patients, or anticoagulant drugs."
How can teachers and schools help kids with dysgraphia?,Acknowledge the condition and talk to your child about it. Talk to your child's teacher about her condition and needs at school. Some things you might ask for include: Shorter writing assignments or different questions from her classmates Use of a computer to type instead of write Copies of the class notes to limit writing work Use of a voice-to-dictation machine or another electronic note taker An option to record the teacher's lectures Video or audio reports instead of written homework assignments Oral instead of written exams

How can I help my child with dysgraphia?,"Here are some things you can try: Have your child use wide-ruled paper, graph paper, or paper with raised lines to help with letter and word alignment. Try pencil grips or other writing aids for comfort. Acknowledge the condition and talk to your child about it. Teach her ways to relieve stress before writing. For example, have her shake or rub her hands together quickly."
When will your doctor use blood test to diagnose allergy?,The most common way to test for allergies is with a skin test. Your doctor will give you very small amounts of the food you may be allergic to and watch for symptoms.
What is the most common way to test for allergies?,"That's because it gives the fastest, most accurate results. The one doctors use most often is called a scratch test. A doctor or nurse will put a tiny drop of an allergen on your skin, usually on the inside of your arm or on your back. Next, she'll prick your skin or make a small scratch on the surface to let the allergen get underneath it. It usually takes about 15 minutes to find out. If they do, there's a good chance you're allergic to those foods."
What are the best ways to prevent skin cancer?,"Both require light anesthesia. Because sputum tests and chest X-rays have not proved particularly effective in detecting small tumors characteristic of early lung cancer, annual chest X-rays for lung cancer screening are not recommended. These drugs are given by IV infusion every 2 â 3 weeks. You can relieve skin irritation associated with radiation therapy by wearing loose clothes and keeping your chest protected from the sun. Avoid using skin lotions unless approved by your doctor."
Are stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation used to treat lung cancer?,"Because sputum tests and chest X-rays have not proved particularly effective in detecting small tumors characteristic of early lung cancer, annual chest X-rays for lung cancer screening are not recommended. This type of therapy may be used to treat localized recurrent tumors as well."
"If a biopsy confirms the presence of a melanoma, what further tests can determine the spread of the disease?","If the biopsy confirms cancer, other tests will determine the type of cancer and how far it has spread. This is uncommon."
Are the number of skin cancer cases increasing in the United States?,"A pack-year is the number of cigarette packs smoked each day multiplied by the number of years a person has smoked. The decision to perform surgery is based not only on the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread but also on the patient's overall health, especially the function of their lungs."
What are the basic things we should know about skin cancer?,"A pack-year is the number of cigarette packs smoked each day multiplied by the number of years a person has smoked. Non-small-cell lung cancers that cannot be treated surgically are usually treated with radiation therapy, usually in combination with chemotherapy. Patients whose cancers have metastasized, or spread to distant parts of the body, are usually treated with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy."
Is radiation therapy used to treat skin cancer?,"Once a malignant tumor begins to cause symptoms, it is usually visible on an X-ray. Non-small-cell lung cancers that cannot be treated surgically are usually treated with radiation therapy, usually in combination with chemotherapy. New combinations of chemotherapy, new forms of radiation, and the use of drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation are always being studied. Gefitinib ( Iressa) has been most recently approved as a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC and offers another targeted therapy for tumors with specific EGFR mutations. You can relieve skin irritation associated with radiation therapy by wearing loose clothes and keeping your chest protected from the sun."
How do lung tumors start?,"If a routine physical exam reveals swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone, a mass in the abdomen, weak breathing, abnormal sounds in the lungs, dullness when the chest is tapped, abnormalities of the pupils, weakness or swollen veins in one of the arms, or even changes in the fingernails, a doctor may suspect a lung tumor. When feasible, the preferred treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer is surgery. Because of its tendency to spread extensively, small-cell lung cancer is typically treated with combination chemotherapy -- the use of more than one drug -- often in conjunction with radiation therapy."
When should I seek medical care for skin cancer?,"If a routine physical exam reveals swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone, a mass in the abdomen, weak breathing, abnormal sounds in the lungs, dullness when the chest is tapped, abnormalities of the pupils, weakness or swollen veins in one of the arms, or even changes in the fingernails, a doctor may suspect a lung tumor. Many patients with lung cancer -- especially smokers -- have existing lung or heart problems that make surgery difficult. After surgery, patients stay in the hospital for several days."
How is skin cancer treated?,"When feasible, the preferred treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer is surgery. During the operation, the surgeon removes the tumor along with surrounding lung tissue and lymph nodes. Radiation therapy may be necessary to kill remaining cancer cells, but it is usually delayed for at least a month while the surgical wound heals. New combinations of chemotherapy, new forms of radiation, and the use of drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation are always being studied."
How is skin cancer treated at home?,"Both require light anesthesia. The challenge comes in detecting lung cancer early enough to make surgery possible. When feasible, the preferred treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer is surgery."
How is malignant melanoma skin cancer treated?,"Nearby lymph nodes can be tested for cancer cells, using a procedure called a mediastinoscopy, which requires general anesthesia, and involves having a small cut made in the front of the neck to pass a hollow, lighted tube into the chest to take biopsies. Endobronchial ultrasound and endoscopic esophageal ultrasound are two other ways to biopsy lymph nodes to test for cancer cells. During the operation, the surgeon removes the tumor along with surrounding lung tissue and lymph nodes. Because of its tendency to spread extensively, small-cell lung cancer is typically treated with combination chemotherapy -- the use of more than one drug -- often in conjunction with radiation therapy."
What tests can diagnose skin cancer?,"If a routine physical exam reveals swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone, a mass in the abdomen, weak breathing, abnormal sounds in the lungs, dullness when the chest is tapped, abnormalities of the pupils, weakness or swollen veins in one of the arms, or even changes in the fingernails, a doctor may suspect a lung tumor. A CT scan of the chest may be ordered for a more detailed look. If the biopsy confirms cancer, other tests will determine the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Sometimes, the entire lung must be taken out. Surgery is occasionally used, but only if the cancer is thought to be at a very early stage."
When is surgery used to treat lung cancer?,"If the biopsy confirms cancer, other tests will determine the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Many patients with lung cancer -- especially smokers -- have existing lung or heart problems that make surgery difficult. Cancer that has spread to lymph nodes between the lungs was once considered inoperable, but combining surgery with chemotherapy afterwards has improved survival rates. When feasible, the preferred treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer is surgery. During the operation, the surgeon removes the tumor along with surrounding lung tissue and lymph nodes. Sometimes, the entire lung must be taken out. After surgery, patients stay in the hospital for several days."
Who can get idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)?,"Doctors use it when they can't pinpoint the cause of a condition. IPF can run in families. Some people with the disease have one or more relatives who have it. In these cases, it's known as familial IPF. Nowadays doctors are able to diagnose IPF more quickly than before."
What conditions are linked to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)?,"Researchers believe some things you may have breathed in could be linked to IPF. So are some infections, such as the flu, Epstein- Barr virus (which causes mononucleosis), hepatitis, and herpes. These things may increase your risk of the disease, although they are not direct causes. People with IPF may also have gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD), also known as acid reflux. Scientists don't know if one disease causes the other, but they suspect that people with GERD may breathe tiny drops of stomach acid into their lungs, which can cause damage over time."
How does idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) change over time?,"There's no cure, and the disease gets worse over time. Cigarette smoking is linked to IPF. For others, the symptoms stay more or less the same for years. Over time, you might get complications like a collapsed lung, infections, blood clots, or pneumonia. In some people, IPF can lead to lung cancer. Nowadays doctors are able to diagnose IPF more quickly than before. And once that happens, they can recommend medications, other treatments, or lifestyle changes that can help you feel better and stay as healthy as possible."
What are treatments of cavernous sinus thrombosis?,"Doctors may order brain scans, including CT and MRI scans, to look for cavernous sinus thrombosis.

How is Paget's disease of the nipple diagnosed?,"Paget's disease of the breast is an uncommon type of cancer that forms in or around the nipple. The doctor will remove a small sample of tissue from your nipple and send it to a lab where they'll check for the presence of Paget's cells. Because most people with this condition also have underlying breast cancer, your diagnosis will probably include: A physical exam Imaging tests: A mammogram ( X-ray of the breast) Breast MRI (a scan that creates a detailed picture of the inside of your breast) Breast ultrasound (uses sound waves to make a picture of your breast) Surgery is the most common treatment."
How is Paget's disease of the nipple treated?,"Because most people with this condition also have underlying breast cancer, your diagnosis will probably include: A physical exam Imaging tests: A mammogram ( X-ray of the breast) Breast MRI (a scan that creates a detailed picture of the inside of your breast) Breast ultrasound (uses sound waves to make a picture of your breast) Surgery is the most common treatment. The surgeon removes the entire breast. If your disease is confined to the nipple and the surrounding area, your doctor could suggest this treatment to save your breast (you might hear it called breast-conserving surgery). The surgeon will remove your nipple, areola, and the entire portion of the breast believed to contain the cancer. Most women get follow-up radiation therapy to make sure the cancer doesn't come back. The specific treatment often depends on the underlying breast cancer. The outlook depends on: If you have a tumor in the affected breast If the tumor is ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer The stage of invasive breast cancer in that breast If you have invasive cancer in the affected breast and it has spread to nearby lymph nodes The 5-year relative survival for all women in the U. S. diagnosed with this condition from 1988 to 2001 was 82.6%."

You might also notice: Tingling Itching Increased sensitivity Burning Pain Bloody or yellowish discharge from your nipple Your nipple looks flattened against your breast Thickened skin in the nipple area In most cases, Paget's disease of the breast starts in the nipple, then spreads to the areola (the circular area of darker skin that surrounds it) or other areas of your breast."
How does a CT scan diagnose headaches?,"You might need one if you have headaches daily or almost every day or have a sudden onset severe headache. Doctors can't diagnose migraines with the test, though. The CT scanner uses X-rays, but the amount of radiation you get from them is kept to a minimum."
How uncomfortable or dangerous is a CT scan?,"You may get a shot of ""contrast material"" into one of your veins, which will help doctors see parts of your brain more clearly on the image. Be sure to tell the doctor or nurse if you've had an allergic reaction to contrast material in the past. Your doctor will also need to check your kidney function before using contrast. The dyes have iodine, which can cause a reaction in some people. The CT scanner uses X-rays, but the amount of radiation you get from them is kept to a minimum. The technologist will help you lie in the correct position on the examining table."

What other tests may your doctor do to check why you have symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,"Your stomach has been feeling crummy for a while now. There are some tests that help figure out what's going on, including a new blood test. One thing to keep in mind: Sometimes the results are inconclusive. For instance, he may check to see if your body isn't able to absorb or digest certain ingredients, like dairy or a simple sugar called fructose. One way to find out is to see if your symptoms get better if you take them out of your diet. You may also need to get a blood test to look for signs of Celiac disease, which happens when your body can't handle gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and oats."

What happens in laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer?,"Tiny incisions are made to create a passageway for a special instrument called a laparoscope. This thin telescope-like instrument with a miniature video camera and light source is used to transmit images to a video monitor. The surgeon watches the video screen while performing the procedure with small instruments that pass through small tubes placed in the incisions. Your surgeon will place a small needle just below your bellybutton and insert the needle into your abdominal cavity. This needle is connected to sterile tubing through which carbon dioxide is passed into the abdominal cavity. The gas lifts the abdominal wall away from the organs below to create space to give your surgeon a better view of your abdominal cavity once the laparoscope is in place. Next, a small incision will be made near your bellybutton. The laparoscope is placed through this incision and is connected to a video camera. The image your surgeon sees in the laparoscope is projected onto video monitors placed near the operating table. Your surgeon will choose the best method at the time of your surgery."
What is it like after colorectal cancer surgery?,"When you arrive in the operating room, the nurses will help you onto the operating table. You will have an oxygen mask covering your nose and mouth. This mask delivers a cool mist of oxygen that helps eliminate the remaining anesthesia from your system and soothes your throat. Your throat may be sore from the breathing tube that was present during your surgery, but this soreness usually subsides after a day or two. Once you are more alert, the nurse may switch your oxygen delivery device to a nasal cannula (small plastic tubing that hooks over your ears and lies beneath your nose). Depending on the percentage of oxygen measured in your blood, you may need to keep the oxygen in place. The nurse will check the oxygen content of your blood by placing a soft clip on one of your fingers. Later, you will be moved to a hospital room where nurses will measure your ""intake and output."" They will document all the fluids that you drink and measure and collect any urine or fluids you produce, including those from tubes or drains placed during surgery."
How can colorectal cancer surgery affect how you eat?,"When you wake up from colorectal cancer surgery, you will be in a recovery room. Surgery can cause the bowel to become swollen and the wave-like contractions that move food along the intestinal tract (called peristalsis) may be reduced after surgery. As a result, food may not pass through the colon as quickly, causing a sense of fullness or bloating. Or, the food may not be as efficient in absorbing some of the water, causing loose stools.

Manuka honey is also marketed for use in many other conditions, including: Preventing and treating cancer Reducing high cholesterol Reducing inflammation inside the body Treating diabetes Treating eye, ear, and sinus infections Treating gastrointestinal problems But the evidence is limited on whether it works for these conditions. Wounds and infections should be seen and treated by a health care professional."
What are the components of manuka honey?,"But not all honey is the same. Hydrogen peroxide gives most honey its antibiotic quality. But some types, including manuka honey, also have other ingredients with antibacterial qualities. The major antibacterial component in manuka honey is methylglyoxal ( MG). MG is a compound found in most types of honey, but usually only in small quantities. In manuka honey, MG comes from the conversion of another compound, dihydroxyacetone, that is found in high concentration in the nectar of manuka flowers. The higher the concentration of MG, the stronger the antibiotic effect. Honey producers have a scale for rating the potency of manuka honey. The rating is called UMF, which stands for Unique Manuka Factor. The UMF rating reflects the concentration of MG. To be considered potent enough to be therapeutic, manuka honey needs a minimum rating of 10 UMF. Honey at or above that level is marketed as "" UMF Manuka Honey"" or "" Active Manuka Honey."" The main medical use for manuka honey is on top of a wound. And there is concern that manuka honey may delay healing in people who have ulcers related to diabetes."
What do scientific studies say about the effectiveness of manuka honey?,"The higher the concentration of MG, the stronger the antibiotic effect. Another recent study suggests that manuka honey may help prevent gingivitis and other periodontal disease by reducing the buildup of plaque. Another possible benefit of honey is that, unlike antibiotics, it doesn't appear to lead to resistant bacteria. These so-called ""superbugs"" develop after repeated exposure to common antibiotics. Special antibiotics are needed to treat them. But most of the studies on manuka honey have been with small numbers of people, and so far, research hasn't shown that manuka honey helps with high cholesterol or balancing the bacteria in the gut. And no major studies have looked at the effect of manuka honey on cancer, diabetes, or fungal infections."

What's a normal range varies with different labs, so check with your doctor to help you understand your result. You usually get results in 1 to 2 days, but it depends on your lab. Generally, your uric acid level is high when: For females, it's over 6 mg/d L For males, it's over 7 mg/d L High levels could be a sign of many conditions, including gout, kidney disease, and cancer. But it could be higher than normal because you eat foods with a lot of purines. That includes dried beans or certain fish such as anchovies, mackerel, and sardines. Usually, your doctor will order other tests at the same time to track down what's causing your symptoms. Your doctor will then help you understand what all your results mean and what your next steps are."

You can wear contact lenses or handheld lenses to see what it'll be like before you get the surgery. If you have more severe astigmatism, you may have laser surgery instead."
How can eyeglass lenses help with treating astigmatism?,"The measurements tell your doctor about the shape of your cornea and how well it can focus. They work well when you look straight ahead. But depending on how much correction you need, they might make the floor or walls look tilted. This should go away as you get used to them. If you have severe astigmatism it might take a week or so. If your sight doesn't get better, ask your doctor to recheck your prescription."
What is a phoropter?,"The doctor will swing that big lens machine (it's called a phoropter) in front of your face. You'll look through it and tell him which lens choice helps you see the best.

After he measures both eyes, he'll give you a prescription for glasses or contacts."
How is astigmatism diagnosed?,A diagnosis starts with a visit to the eye doctor. Keratometry. This machine measures the bend in the center of your cornea. It determines the steepest and the flattest curves. The measurements tell your doctor about the shape of your cornea and how well it can focus. The doctor also uses the keratometer to fit contact lenses and to check your cornea after eye surgery.

What drugs will you need to treat diabetes?,"Your blood sugar (also called blood glucose) levels may be high if your pancreas is producing little or no insulin (type 1 diabetes), or if the body is not responding normally to insulin (type 2 diabetes). You will need insulin in the form of injections or through use of a continuous pump. Learning to give injections to yourself or to your infant or child may at first seem the most daunting part of managing diabetes, but it is much easier that you think. Some people with diabetes use a computerized pump -- called an insulin pump -- that gives insulin on a set basis. You and your doctor program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin throughout the day (the basal dose). Plus, you program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin based on your blood sugar level before you eat (bolus dose)."

Is lung cancer visible on an X-ray?,"Once lung cancer begins to cause symptoms, it is usually visible on an X-ray. Occasionally, lung cancer that has not yet begun to cause symptoms is spotted on a chest X-ray taken for another purpose. Nearby lymph nodes can be tested for cancer cells with a procedure called a mediastinoscopy, while imaging techniques such as CT scans, PET scans, bone scans, and either an MRI or a CT scan of the brain can detect cancer elsewhere in the body."
What tests do doctors use to determine the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread?,"Lung cancer, which originates in the lungs, can also spread to other parts of the body, such as distant bones, the liver, adrenal glands, or the brain. Nearby lymph nodes can be tested for cancer cells with a procedure called a mediastinoscopy, while imaging techniques such as CT scans, PET scans, bone scans, and either an MRI or a CT scan of the brain can detect cancer elsewhere in the body."
How long will I be contagious due to  bronchitis?,"The first few days you're sick, it will probably be hard to tell if you have a âregularâ cold or bronchitis. Since you may not know what kind of illness you have -- and doctors don't test for individual viruses, since there are hundreds of them -- it's best to assume you could spread the disease while you have cold symptoms. There's blood in the mucus you cough up, or you have other symptoms that seem unusual for a cold."
How can you tell if benign episodic unilateral mydriasis is causing your pupils to appear large?,"When it's bright, they get smaller, or constrict, to let in less light. Medicines, injuries, and diseases can all cause this eye condition. Ask your eye doctor if you need to avoid driving until your pupils go back to their normal size."
What are optimal doses of black currant?,"Optimal doses of black currant have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker.

Since most children outgrow rumination disorder, and older children and adults with this disorder tend to be secretive about it out of embarrassment, it is difficult to know exactly how many people are affected. Rumination disorder most often occurs in infants and very young children (between 3 and 12 months), and in children with intellectual disabilities."
How do doctors diagnose temporal arteritis?,"They'll also look for swelling and a weak pulse in the temporal artery in your scalp. You may need a biopsy of the temporal artery. If so, your doctor will numb an area of your scalp and remove a small piece of the temporal artery. A doctor will then check it under a microscope. The cells of an inflamed artery look very large under the microscope. Your doctor will do blood tests every few months to see if the inflammation in your arteries has gone down."
What is the link between temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica?,"The swelling slows blood flow through your arteries, and that can cause symptoms like headaches and pain in your face and joints.

What is involved in the process of staging for lung cancer?,"It depends on what type of lung cancer you have and how advanced it is. This usually involves getting a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, and possibly a PET scan. You may also get a bone scan, a CT or MRI scan of the brain, and other tests."
What are the treatments for advanced lung cancer?,"You might get radiation and chemotherapy to shrink tumors and help control symptoms. Before recommending which treatment or combination of treatments is right for you, your doctor will determine how advanced your lung cancer is, a process called staging."
What raises my risk of lung cancer?,"Although the disease is the No. It's much more common among people who smoke. Other risk factors are exposure to asbestos, radon gas, air pollution, and having had radiation therapy before. Smoking is almost always the cause."
Can non-smokers get lung cancer?,"But people who have never smoked can get it too. For some of these people, breathing in secondhand smoke may be a culprit, or there may be genetic or environmental causes, such as if you work with asbestos or are exposed to high levels of radon over a long time."

Always put fragrance on your clothes, not your skin. The labels ""hypoallergenic,"" ""dermatologist tested,"" ""sensitivity tested,"" or ""non-irritating"" don't guarantee that your skin won't react."
How can you avoid an allergic reaction to beauty products?,"You'll be less likely to have a skin reaction to it. To make sure no perfume is included, look for products marked âfragrance-freeâ or âwithout perfume.â Preservatives are in almost every product that contains water. All of the most common preservatives have been linked to skin allergies. But that doesn't mean they cause allergic reactions in everyone. They might not bother your skin at all."
What is neuromuscular therapy massage?,"Four common strokes of Swedish massage are: Effleurage: a smooth, gliding stroke used to relax soft tissue Petrissage: the squeezing, rolling, or kneading that follows effleurage Friction: deep, circular movements that cause layers of tissue to rub against each other, helping to increase blood flow and break down scar tissue Tapotement: a short, alternating tap done with cupped hands, fingers, or the edge of the hand Deep tissue massage is best for giving attention to certain painful, stiff ""trouble spots"" in your body.

Can high blood pressure cause systolic heart failure?,"With that extra work, your heart muscle gets thicker and doesn't work as well. In those cases, the heart has to pump harder to get blood through your body."
Is there a cure for myelofibrosis?,"Only through a process called allogenic stem cell transplantation. In MF, your stem cells don't work like they should. This causes scar tissue to build up in your bone marrow. During this treatment, you're given healthy stem cells from a donor to replace your faulty ones. So you should only try it if you have a high chance of complications from your MF. This treatment could make it more likely for you to get blood clots."
Can chemotherapy help with spleen swelling in myelofibrosis?,"Chemotherapy. Drugs like hydroxyurea ( Droxia, Hydrea, Siklos) or cladribine can help shrink your spleen and ease your pain. Hydroxyurea isn't good for you if you have severe anemia, and it could cause skin ulcers. Cladribine may cause bleeding or raise your risk of infections."
Why is allogenic stem cell transplantation risky?,"Before you start, you'll need high doses either of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy the cells in your bone marrow.

Among the most common side effects are: Swelling Bruising around the eyes Crusting on the ""donor"" and ""recipient"" sites of the scalp A lack of feeling or sensation around the ""donor"" and ""recipient"" sites of the scalp Itching at the ""donor"" site Scalp Reduction A scalp reduction is the removal of non-hair-bearing skin from the scalp so that the remaining hair-bearing skin can be stretched to fill in the bald area of the head."
How effective is the birth control sponge?,"It's a form of birth control that some women use. To protect against STDs such as HIV, the male condom provides the best protection."
How are cleft lip and cleft palate diagnosed?,"A cleft palate can involve the hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), and/or the soft palate (the soft back portion of the roof of the mouth). Because the lip and the palate develop separately, it is possible to have a cleft lip without a cleft palate, a cleft palate without a cleft lip, or both together. If the clefting has not been detected in an ultrasound prior to the baby's birth, a physical exam of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms the presence of cleft lip or cleft palate after a child's birth. Sometimes diagnostic testing may be conducted to determine or rule out the presence of other abnormalities."
How can dental problems happen from a cleft lip and cleft palate?,"This separation often extends beyond the base of the nose and includes the bones of the upper jaw and/or upper gum. A defect in the alveolus can (1) displace, tip, or rotate permanent teeth, (2) prevent permanent teeth from appearing, and (3) prevent the alveolar ridge from forming. These problems can usually be repaired through oral surgery. However, children with cleft lip and cleft palate may have special problems related to missing, malformed, or malpositioned teeth that require close monitoring."
What does the treatment for cleft lip and cleft palate involve?,"Cleft lip and cleft palate can occur on one or both sides of the mouth. Repair of a cleft palate often requires multiple surgeries over the course of 18 years. The first surgery to repair the palate usually occurs when the baby is between 6 and 12 months old. The initial surgery creates a functional palate, reduces the chances that fluid will develop in the middle ears, and aids in the proper development of the teeth and facial bones. Children with a cleft palate may also need a bone graft when they are about 8 years old to fill in the upper gum line so that it can support permanent teeth and stabilize the upper jaw. About 20% of children with a cleft palate require further surgeries to help improve their speech. Once the permanent teeth grow in, braces are often needed to straighten the teeth. Additional surgeries may be performed to improve the appearance of the lip and nose, close openings between the mouth and nose, help breathing, and stabilize and realign the jaw. Final repairs of the scars left by the initial surgery will probably not be performed until adolescence, when the facial structure is more fully developed."
What does early dental care involve for a cleft lip and cleft palate?,"However, children with cleft lip and cleft palate may have special problems related to missing, malformed, or malpositioned teeth that require close monitoring. Appropriate cleaning with a small, soft-bristled toothbrush should begin as soon as teeth erupt. If a soft children's toothbrush will not adequately clean the teeth because of the modified shape of the mouth and teeth, a toothette may be recommended by your dentist. A toothette is a soft, mouthwash-containing sponge on a handle that's used to swab teeth. Many dentists recommend that the first dental visit be scheduled at about 1 year of age or even earlier if there are special dental problems. Routine dental care can begin around 1 year of age."
What is the recommended dental care for children with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate?,"Due to the number of oral health and medical problems associated with a cleft lip or cleft palate, a team of doctors and other specialists is usually involved in the care of these children.

What is the similarities and differences between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure?,"Breathing problems happen for different reasons with these conditions. But when you're active, your breath starts coming in before air from your last exhale goes out. That causes shortness of breath. If you have heart failure, your heart doesn't pump blood efficiently. As with COPD, if you have heart failure, you can probably breathe easily when at rest. With activity, blood flow must increase, and your heart must pump harder and faster. If your heart can't keep up, blood âbacks upâ into your lungs. This fluid congestion causes shortness of breath. If you have both COPD and heart failure and find yourself short of breath, it can be hard to tell which condition is causing your breathing problems."
What are commonly used drugs associated with serious alcohol interactions?,"If you have both COPD and heart failure and find yourself short of breath, it can be hard to tell which condition is causing your breathing problems. In these cases, the more severe condition is more likely to be the cause of breathing symptoms."
Why are older Americans at special risk of alcohol interactions with medication?,Breathing problems happen for different reasons with these conditions. It's not directly related to COPD. Many conditions other than COPD also cause right-sided heart failure.
How are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and right-sided heart failure linked?,"Severe COPD can cause heart failure in your heart's lower right chamber, or ventricle. Many conditions other than COPD also cause right-sided heart failure."
Can alcohol alter the effectiveness of medication?,"Your doctor may give you: Physical examination: Listening to your lungs and heart, and looking at the veins in your neck, can help your doctor tell the difference between COPD and heart failure. In these cases, the more severe condition is more likely to be the cause of breathing symptoms."
What is the difference between multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?,"Multifocal motor neuropathy ( MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. They have similar symptoms, like twitching. Unlike ALS, though, MMN is treatable."

The condition makes it hard for them to send the electrical signals that move your body, which makes your hands and arms feel weak. They'll also twitch and cramp. MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. But for many people, symptoms may be so mild that they don't need treatment at all. Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease."
What causes motor neuropathy (MMN)?,"Multifocal motor neuropathy ( MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. No one knows what causes MMN. Scientists do know it's an autoimmune disease, meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells as if they were invaders. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens."
What should I expect if I have multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)?,"Multifocal motor neuropathy ( MMN) is a disease that affects your body's motor nerves. If you get treatment for MMN early, you're more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. If you have trouble with certain activities, you may want to see an occupational or physical therapist. They can help you keep your muscles strong and show you how to do daily tasks more easily if your muscles are bothering you. Many people with MMN can continue most or at least some of their normal activities. If your hand muscles are weak, you may have trouble eating, typing, writing, or buttoning clothes. If your leg muscles are affected, you could have trouble walking. Some people with severe MMN have trouble in all these areas."

What will happen after deep brain stimulation (DBS) for epilepsy?,"After your surgery, your doctor will turn on the DBS device with a small computer called a programming unit. He'll use it to adjust the speed and intensity of the electrical signals to control your seizures. You'll also get a programming unit to take home, so you can adjust your device and track any seizures you get. DBS might not stop your seizures completely, but it should cut down how many you get. You'll need to get the battery replaced every 3 to 4 years."
How does deep brain stimulation (DBS) for epilepsy work?,"When you have epilepsy, abnormal bursts of electrical activity in these brain cells set off seizures. When you get DBS, the tiny electrodes that your doctor puts into your brain deliver an electric current. This interrupts the abnormal electrical signals and helps prevent seizures. It's kind of like having a pacemaker for your brain. Electrical signals will travel from the neurostimulator to the leads in your brain."

What causes oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)?,"Biological: Some studies suggest that defects in or injuries to certain areas of the brain can lead to serious behavioral problems in children. Further, many children and teens with ODD also have other mental illnesses, such as ADHD, learning disorders, depression, or an anxiety disorder, which may contribute to their behavior problems. Genetics: Many children and teens with ODD have close family members with mental illnesses, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Environmental: Factors such as a dysfunctional family life, a family history of mental illnesses and/or substance abuse, and inconsistent discipline by parents may contribute to the development of behavior disorders."
How is oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) diagnosed?,"As with adults, mental illnesses in children are diagnosed based on signs and symptoms that suggest a particular illness like ODD. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose ODD, the doctor may sometimes use tests such as neuroimaging studies or blood tests if they suspect that there may be a medical explanation for the behavior problems that occur. The doctor also will look for signs of other conditions that often occur along with ODD, such as ADHD and depression. If the doctor cannot find a physical cause for the symptoms, he or she will likely refer the child to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist, mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses in children and teens. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a child for a mental illness. The doctor often must rely on reports from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults because children often have trouble explaining their problems or understanding their symptoms."
What is oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)?,"When this behavior lasts longer than six months and is excessive compared to what is usual for the child's age, it may mean that the child has a type of behavior disorder called oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD). The child's behavior often disrupts the child's normal daily activities, including activities within the family and at school. Many children and teens with ODD also have other behavioral problems, such as attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, mood disorders (such as depression), and anxiety disorders. Some children with ODD go on to develop a more serious behavior disorder called conduct disorder."
What makes some people more likely to get addicted to prescription drugs?,"Opioids can also be life-threatening in an overdose. Your biology, social environment, and age or stage of growth seem to affect how likely you are to get addicted.

It seems to be a mix of hormone changes during your menstrual cycle, chemical changes in the brain, and other emotional issues you might have, such as depression, that can make PMS worse. What's more, once you get your period, the rollercoaster may continue. One study found that period-related pains such as cramps, bloating, backaches, and headaches can cloud your thinking, because the pain may make it harder for you to focus on the tasks at hand. Not that you can't still do them -- you can. It may just feel like it takes more work. Lifestyle changes are usually the best way to take control of PMS. Aim to get about 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, get 8 hours of shut-eye per night, and don't smoke.

Depending on the size, cysts may feel firm or spongy. Media file 2: The jellylike fluid taken from the cyst in Image 1."
What exams and tests are used to diagnose ganglion cysts?,Your doctor may get further confirmation by using a syringe to draw out some of the fluid in the cyst (needle aspiration) or by using ultrasound. An ultrasound picture is made as sound waves bounce off of different tissues. It can determine whether the bump is fluid-filled (cystic) or if it is solid. Ultrasound can also detect whether there is an artery or blood vessel causing the lump. Your doctor may send you to a hand surgeon if the bump is large or solid or involves a blood vessel (artery). Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is used to see the wrist and is very useful for ganglions. One drawback to this diagnostic method is the cost of the procedure. Your doctor may ask you to return for a check-up after your surgery and will decide if physical or occupational therapy is needed.

Specific conditions and their treatments include: Vitamin deficiency. Taking additional vitamin B12 orally or by injection can replace low levels of this nutrient. Alcoholism. Stopping excessive drinking prevents ongoing nerve damage and allows nerves to heal. Chronic kidney disease. Dialysis may be necessary to eliminate toxins causing neuropathy and burning feet symptoms. Hypothyroidism. Taking oral thyroid hormone raises low thyroid levels, often reversing neuropathy as well as burning feet symptoms. Treatments are very specialized and include plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) or immune globulin therapy ( IVIG)."
What causes burning feet?,"Diabetes and alcohol abuse are by far the most common causes of neuropathy in the legs.

When is a combination implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker therapy recommended to treat heart failure?,"People with heart failure who have poor ejection fractions (measurement that shows how well the heart pumps with each beat) are at risk for fast irregular heart rhythms -- some of which can be life-threatening -- called arrhythmias. Currently, doctors use an ICD to prevent these dangerous rhythms. The device works by detecting such a rhythm and shocking the heart back to normal. These devices can combine biventricular pacing with anti-tachycardia (fast heart rate) pacing and internal defibrillators ( ICDs) to deliver treatment as needed. Current studies are showing that resynchronization may even lessen the amount of arrhythmia that occurs, decreasing the times the ICD needs to shock the heart. These devices are helping heart failure patients live longer and improving their quality of life. This check is very important because adjustments will be made that can prolong the life of your pacemaker."
What happens to my heart if I have heart failure?,"In the normal heart, the heart's lower chambers (ventricles) pump in sync with the heart's upper chambers (atria). When a person has heart failure, often the right and left ventricles do not pump synchronously. In addition, the heart failure patient may or may not need this type of pacemaker to treat slow heart rhythms and may or may not need an internal defibrillator (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD), which is designed to treat people at risk for sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrests."
How often do I need to get the pacemaker checked?,"After your pacemaker check, an echocardiogram may be done. This check is very important because adjustments will be made that can prolong the life of your pacemaker. After that, your pacemaker should be checked every six months using a telephone transmitter to evaluate battery function. The nurse will explain how to check your pacemaker using the telephone transmitter. When the battery gets low, you will need to replace your pacemaker."
How does a traditional pacemaker work?,"Pacemakers regulate the right atrium and right ventricle to maintain a good heart rate and keep the atrium and ventricle working together. This is called AV synchrony. In addition, the heart failure patient may or may not need this type of pacemaker to treat slow heart rhythms and may or may not need an internal defibrillator (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD), which is designed to treat people at risk for sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrests."
How do I prepare for the biventricular pacemaker implant?,"Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take before your pacemaker is implanted. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain drugs several days before your procedure. If you must take medications, drink only small sips of water to help you swallow your pills. If you are uncomfortable or need anything during the procedure, please let the nurse know."

How effective is Ritalin in ADHD patients?,"Parents sometimes worry whether the stimulant drugs their children are taking to treat ADHD (such as Ritalin and Adderall) are themselves addictive. When carefully taken as prescribed, though, Ritalin is less likely to be addictive in children or adults. It's important to remember that not everyone with ADHD will develop an alcohol or substance abuse problem."
How similar is Ritalin to cocaine?,"What's more, people with ADHD typically start having problems with drugs and alcohol at an earlier age than people without the condition. However, researchers have found marked differences between the two drugs. One of the factors that leads to addiction and drug abuse is how quickly a drug raises dopamine levels. The faster dopamine levels go up, the greater the potential for abuse. One researcher found that Ritalin takes about an hour to raise dopamine levels in the brain, compared to only seconds with inhaled cocaine. The doses of Ritalin and other stimulants used to treat ADHD tend to be lower and longer-acting, which reduces the risk of addiction. Long-term use of all stimulants can sometimes lead to a phenomenon called tolerance -- that is, higher doses are needed to achieve the same effect of a controlled substance. If and when this happens, a doctor may then be more likely to consider using nonstimulant medicines to treat ADHD."

How is surgery used to treat colorectal cancer?,"The main types of treatment for colorectal cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Usually, the surgeon can reconnect the healthy sections of the colon and rectum. When this is not possible, the surgeon forms an opening -- known as a stoma -- in the abdomen and reroutes the severed colon to it. Waste is collected in a bag worn over the stoma. This procedure, known as a colostomy, often is only temporary. Once the bowel has had time to heal, a second operation reconnects the colon and rectum. The need for permanent colostomy is more common with rectal cancer, since retaining the rectum may be difficult. Radiation therapy can be used in people with colon cancer when the tumor has attached to another organ in the abdomen, or if a tumor is found near the margins of the cancer that was removed. These drugs work by blocking the cancer's blood supply or blocking a protein or genetic change made by the cancer to enhance it growth."

Tapering down your medication gradually under the supervision of your health care provider can help avoid or minimize symptoms. However, it is still possible in those who decrease their dose too rapidly or sometimes even slowly quit the medicine.

What valves are involved in the heart?,"As blood leaves each chamber of the heart, it passes through a valve. There are four heart valves within the heart: Mitral valve Tricuspid valve Aortic valve Pulmonic valve (also called pulmonary valve) The tricuspid and mitral valves lie between the atria and ventricles. The aortic and pulmonic valves lie between the ventricles and the major blood vessels leaving the heart. The atria and ventricles work together, alternately contracting and relaxing to pump blood through your heart."
What triggers a heart beat?,"This is your heartbeat. The impulse starts in a small bundle of specialized cells called the SA node (sinoatrial node), located in the right atrium. This node is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The electrical activity spreads through the walls of the atria and causes them to contract. A cluster of cells in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles, the AV node (atrioventricular node) is like a gate that slows the electrical signal before it enters the ventricles. This delay gives the atria time to contract before the ventricles do. The His- Purkinje network is a pathway of fibers that sends the electrical impulse from the AV node to the muscular walls of the ventricles, causing them to contract."
What are the three main types of blood vessels?,"In addition to carrying fresh oxygen from the lungs and nutrients to your body's tissues, it also takes the body's waste products, including carbon dioxide, away from the tissues.

These are blood vessels that take blood back to the heart; this blood contains less oxygen and is rich in waste products that are to be excreted or removed from the body. Veins become larger as they get closer to the heart. The superior vena cava is the large vein that brings blood from the head and arms to the heart, and the inferior vena cava brings blood from the abdomen and legs into the heart. This vast system of blood vessels -- arteries, veins, and capillaries -- is over 60,000 miles long. That's long enough to go around the world more than twice! Blood flows continuously through your body's blood vessels. Your heart is the pump that makes it all possible. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. The heart receives its own supply of blood from a network of arteries, called the coronary arteries."

What are the benefits of ulcerative colitis surgery?,"In this procedure, the colon and rectum are removed. This should put an end to the diarrhea, abdominal pains, anemia, and other symptoms. In addition, this surgical procedure prevents colon cancer. Overall, an estimated 5% of ulcerative colitis patients will develop cancer. The elimination of the colon cancer threat is especially significant for people who have ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon. In these cases, as opposed to cases of ulcerative colitis that affects only the lower colon and the rectum, the cancer risk without surgery could be up to 32 times the normal rate."
What types of surgery treat ulcerative colitis?,"Surgery to remove the entire colon is called a colectomy. Surgery to remove both the colon and rectum is a proctocolectomy. Both can be used to treat ulcerative colitis. These surgeries are also performed to eliminate the threat of colon cancer. Colon cancer is common in people with ulcerative colitis. Proctocolectomy is considered the standard treatment when surgery for ulcerative colitis is needed. If the entire colon is removed, the surgeon may create an opening, or stoma, in the abdominal wall. The tip of the lower small intestine is brought through the stoma. An external bag, or pouch, is attached to the stoma. This is called a permanent ileostomy. Stools pass through this opening and collect in the pouch. The pouch must be worn at all times. Another procedure is the pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis ( IPAA). This is a procedure that does not require a permanent stoma. This surgery is also called a restorative proctocolectomy. The patient is still able to eliminate stool through the anus. In this procedure, the colon and rectum are removed. Then the small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir -- called a J-pouch -- that will serve as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus. This procedure is frequently done in two operations. In between the operations the patient needs a temporary ileostomy. The continent ileostomy, or Kock pouch, is an option for people who would like their ileostomy converted to an internal pouch. It's also an option for people who do not qualify for the IPAA procedure. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. The colon and rectum are removed, and an internal reservoir is created from the small intestine. An opening is made in the abdominal wall, and the reservoir is then joined to the skin with a nipple valve. If the entire colon and rectum are removed, ulcerative colitis is cured. This should put an end to the diarrhea, abdominal pains, anemia, and other symptoms. In addition, this surgical procedure prevents colon cancer. Overall, an estimated 5% of ulcerative colitis patients will develop cancer. The elimination of the colon cancer threat is especially significant for people who have ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon. In these cases, as opposed to cases of ulcerative colitis that affects only the lower colon and the rectum, the cancer risk without surgery could be up to 32 times the normal rate."
Are there different types of schizophrenia?,"Doctors who specialize in mental health used to divide schizophrenia into different subtypes: Catatonic Disorganized Paranoid Residual Undifferentiated. But that system didn't work well. Now, experts talk about schizophrenia as a spectrum disorder that includes all the previous subtypes.

These are simple at-home tests that check for hidden blood in the stool from multiple samples. Or Flexible sigmoidoscopyperformed every 5 years. This is an outpatient procedure for examining the inside of the lower portion of the large intestine, called the sigmoid colon, and also the rectum. This test can miss polyps, cancer, or other abnormalities that are beyond the reach of the scope. If abnormalities are detected, a colonoscopy needs to be done. Or Colonoscopy, performed once every 10 years; this is the preferred test. CT colongraphy (virtual colonoscopy) performed every 5 years. This can miss small polyps. If any abnormalities are detected, a colonoscopy is needed."

Tests to help detect colorectal polyps and cancer include: Sigmoidoscopy. This is a procedure used to examine the rectum and very last part of the colon. This test can detect polyps, cancer, and other abnormalities in the sigmoid colon and rectum. During this exam, a biopsy (tissue sample) may also be removed and sent for testing. Colonoscopy. A colonoscopy examines the entire colon and rectum. This is a special X-ray test (also referred to as a virtual colonoscopy) done of the entire colon using a CT (computed tomography) scanner. This test takes less time and is less invasive than other tests. However, if a polyp is detected, a standard colonoscopy needs to be performed.

When was islet cell transplantation developed and how successful has it been?,"Beta cells are one type of cell found in the islets of the pancreas and produce insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. But in 1999, a clinical trial conducted at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, brought new hope. Using enhanced techniques to collect and prepare the extremely fragile donor islet cells, as well as using improved anti-rejection drugs, the researchers achieved a 100% success rate. All of the patients in their trial were freed from the need for insulin for at least one month. However, the success of the '' Edmonton Protocol,'' as it was called, was not as successful in later trials, and the number of islet cell transplantations has decreased in more recent years. The Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry reported in 2009 that 70% of adults with Type I diabetes were free of insulin injections at one year, 50% at two years, and 35% at three years. Researchers are also working to develop methods of transplanting islet cells that will reduce or eliminate the risk of rejection and the need for immunosuppression."

What is the treatment for bipolar disorder with rapid cycling?,"A rapid cycling pattern may occur in about 10% to 20% of people with the disorder. Repeated periods of depression are punctuated by infrequent, shorter periods of elevated or normal mood. Because symptoms of depression dominate in most people with a rapid cycling course of bipolar disorder, treatment is usually aimed toward stabilizing mood, mainly by relieving depression while preventing the comings-and-goings of new episodes. Antidepressants such as Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft have not been shown to treat the depression symptoms of rapid cycling bipolar disorder, and may even increase the frequency of new episodes over time. Mood-stabilizing drugs -- such as lithium, Depakote, Tegretol and Lamictal -- are the core treatments of rapid cycling. Often, a single mood stabilizer is ineffective at controlling episode recurrences, resulting in a need for combinations of mood stabilizers. Several antipsychotic medicines such as Zyprexa or Seroquel also have been studied in rapid cycling and are used as part of a treatment regimen, regardless of the presence or absence of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations). This helps prevent future episodes."

It can be caused by some of the same conditions you see with sinus bradycardia. They pump and squeeze in a rhythm so your body has a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood. But most of the time, it comes from something you got later in life. The main cause is a heart attack. They include: Heart failure, because the heart is not pumping enough blood for your body Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle Coronary artery disease, or narrowing of the arteries in the heart Rheumatic fever, which is most common in children who didn't get treated well for strep throat or scarlet fever You may not need any treatment if you have a mild case."
What type of bradycardia is sick sinus syndrome?,"If your doctor says you or a loved one has bradycardia, a resting heart beat that's less than 60 beats per minute, it's only part of the diagnosis. This type of bradycardia causes an abnormal heart rhythm. You may have irregular heartbeats or ones that flip between slow and fast. This syndrome is not as common. It is often the result of heart disease. If you've had a heart attack or surgery, the sinus node may be scarred or damaged. Sometimes the normal wear and tear on your heart as you age is the reason Your heart has four chambers."
What is sinus bradycardia?,"If your doctor says you or a loved one has bradycardia, a resting heart beat that's less than 60 beats per minute, it's only part of the diagnosis. That's a group of cells that sends out electrical signals that tell you when to pump out more blood. It may be mild enough that you never notice any symptoms. With a more serious case, you might have dizziness, breathing problems, and chest pains, among other problems. This syndrome is not as common."
What conditions can cause sinus bradycardia?,"If your doctor says you or a loved one has bradycardia, a resting heart beat that's less than 60 beats per minute, it's only part of the diagnosis.

Commonly referred to as pre-diabetes, this condition occurs when a person's blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes."
What are TNR programs?,"Many experts agree that one of the best ways to help feral cats and cat groups -- called colonies -- is through neutering programs. According to web site of the American Association of Feline Practitioners, stray and feral cats are “humanely trapped, examined, vaccinated, and surgically sterilized by veterinarians.” Feral cats are then returned to their familiar environment and, hopefully, cared for by volunteers, who may provide food and shelter, and monitor them for sickness."
How can you tell a stray from a feral cat?,"They tend to stay away from humans, hide during the day, and when adopted, are very difficult to socialize. Lost or abandoned felines are usually comfortable around people and will frequently attempt to live near humans -- under porches, or in garages, sheds, or backyards."
What can you do for feral cats?,"“ It goes without saying that you should spay and neuter your own cats,” says Linda P. Case, MS, author of Canine and Feline Behavior and Training: A Complete Guide to Understanding Our Two Best Friends. She also suggests keeping your cat indoors -- not only for her safety, but also to prevent her from getting lost and ending up part of a feral colony. Feeding feral and stray cats is generous, but they need health care as well. You can also donate money to animal welfare groups through an estate or will. If you can’t aid in a clinical setting, you can be involved at the community level -- contacting local veterinarians and businesses, writing letters, fund-raising, or staffing a booth at a community event. Become a colony caretaker."
What are the benefits of TNR programs?,"Trap-neuter-return ( TNR) endeavors are geared toward reducing the number of unwanted cats by catching and then neutering or spaying them. Neutered cats tend to gain weight and have fewer health problems -- such as breast, testicular, and uterine cancer. Fewer females in heat also means fewer toms attracted to an area, and so fewer risky cat fights. Ultimately, less cat suffering also means less human suffering in the face of dying or injured cats."

What are my options for carpal tunnel surgery?,"After the surgery, the ligament comes back together, but with more room for the median nerve to pass through. Open surgery involves a larger cut, or incision -- up to 2 inches from your wrist to your palm. In endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one opening in your wrist. He then places a tiny camera in one of the openings to guide him as he cuts the ligament. Because the openings are smaller with endoscopic surgery, you may heal faster and have less pain. For both types of carpal tunnel release surgery, they include: Bleeding Damage to your median nerve or nearby nerves and blood vessels Infection of your wound A scar that hurts to touch First, you'll get local anesthesia -- drugs to numb your hand and wrist."

For example, if a too-tight stomach is causing side effects, the bands can be loosened. Gastric banding is also less likely to cause nutritional problems."
What happens during gastric bypass surgery?,"The procedure has two parts: The surgeon divides the stomach into a large portion and a much smaller one. Then, in a process sometimes called ""stomach stapling,â the small part of the stomach is sewn or stapled together to make a pouch, which can hold only a cup or so of food.

People with somatic symptom disorder are not faking or lying about their symptoms; they truly believe they are sick. Or, if they do have an actual physical illness, their level of worry and distress is out of proportion to the condition. Factors that might be involved in the development of the disorder include: A history of physical or sexual abuse A history of having a serious illness as a child A poor ability to express emotions A parent or close relative with the disorder; children might learn this behavior if a parent is overly concerned about disease and/or overreacts to even minor illnesses An inherited susceptibility for the disorder Diagnosing somatic symptom disorder can be very difficult, because people with the disorder are convinced their symptoms and feelings of distress are explainable by a medical illness."""

Because everyone is different, you and your child might want to determine if you can figure out any food triggers that seem to affect whether your child wets the bed."
Does caffeine cause bed-wetting?,"So, one bed-wetting solution many experts recommend is to avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening. Just because your child doesn't drink coffee doesn't mean he isn't ingesting caffeine. Teas, colas, and energy drinks often contain caffeine. And one food that many children love, chocolate, also contains a chemical closely related to caffeine.

Generally, you will be able to resume your usual activities immediately. The results of your mammogram will be given to your doctor, who will discuss with you what the test results could mean and what further tests might be recommended. All mammography facilities are now required to send your results by mail to you within 30 days. You will be contacted within five working days if there is a problem with your mammogram. If you do not hear about your test findings within 10 working days, don't assume your results are normal -- call your doctor to make sure. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately one to two mammograms out of every 1,000 lead to a diagnosis of cancer. Approximately 10% of women will require additional mammography. Don't be alarmed if this happens to you. Only 8% to 10% of those women will need a biopsy, and 80% of those biopsies won't be cancer. Those odds may improve with more widespread use of three-dimensional mammography."
How should you prepare for a mammogram?,"No dietary changes are necessary. Take your medicines as usual. Do not wear body powder, cream, deodorant, or lotion on your chest the day of the test. These substances may interfere with the X-rays. At the time of the mammogram, you will be asked to remove all clothing above the waist and you will be given a hospital gown to wear. You may want to wear a two-piece outfit the day of the test. You will be asked to remove all jewelry. If you feel that the pressure on your breast is too great, tell the technologist performing the exam."
What is hyperlipidemia?,"Either way, it's a common problem. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The term covers several disorders that result in extra fats, also known as lipids, in your blood. You can control some of its causes; but not all of them. It's not something you can feel, but you'll notice the effects of it someday. Your doctor should check your lipid levels regularly."
How can you treat a nagging cough related to HIV?,"It's important to see your doctor if you think you have shingles. In addition to following your doctor's advice, do these things to bring down a fever: Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen Use cold compresses Nagging cough: A cough isn't always a sign of something serious. But one that hangs around for weeks can be. People with low CD4 counts are more likely to get a lung infection called pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP). It can cause a dry cough, shortness of breath, and make you feel very tired. People with weak immune systems are more likely to get tuberculosis ( TB). You may bring up lots of phlegm when you cough and have chest pain, fever, and weight loss, too. If tests show that you have TB, you'll need to take antibiotics for several months."
What tests are done for  blood in your urine?,"Be ready to answer these questions for the health care provider: What color was the blood in the urine? The health care provider may order one or more of these tests: Urinalysis to check for urinary tract infection or kidney disease Blood test to check for kidney disease Kidney imaging studies to check for a tumor, kidney or bladder stone, enlarged prostate, or blockage to urine flow Cystoscopic examination (looking at the inside of the bladder with a very thin scope) to check for a tumor or bladder stone"
What questions will my doctor ask about the blood in the urine?,"Call your health care provider to set up a prompt appointment, even if you only see blood once in the urine. Were there blood clots? If so, what size and shape? Was there blood at the beginning or end of the urine stream or during the entire stream? Was it painful for to urinate? Where was the pain located (for example, back, side, groin, or genital area)? Are there other symptoms, such as frequent or urgent urination? Burning during urination? Fever or chills?"
What is urge incontinence?,"While urge incontinence is sometimes referred to as ""overactive bladder,"" that condition is slightly different; people with an overactive bladder feel an urge to urinate but don't necessarily leak urine. To practice timed voiding, you use a chart to record the times that you urinate and when you leak urine."
What is decompensated heart failure?,Decompensated heart failure can also make you feel tired and could make it harder to exercise or even do simple things like folding laundry. You may have abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Medications and devices such as artificial pumps can help you manage symptoms and keep up your quality of life.
What is tachycardia?,"It beats faster. This tends to happen in decompensated heart failure. Tachycardia can lead to several complications, including blood clots in the heart and fainting. The extra heartbeats can also weaken the heart muscle further. The downside of all this is that your heart can't keep it up, so after a while, it just won't be able to pump blood throughout your body anymore."
How much protein should you get if you have prostate cancer?,The side effects of cancer treatment are often made worse if you are not eating enough or if you are not eating the right foods. The current recommended daily allowance ( RDA) for protein needs are 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weigh. Example: A 150-pound person needs 54 grams of protein per day. Cancer stresses the body and you may need more protein while undergoing treatment.
How can a dietitian help if you have prostate cancer?,"Make sure you are getting enough vitamins. A registered dietitian can provide suggestions to work around any eating problems that may be interfering with proper nutrition (such as early feeling of fullness, swallowing difficulty, or taste changes)."
What are symptoms of diabetes that looks like Alzheimer's?,"In some people, especially those of advanced age, UTIs can cause a sudden onset of symptoms that look like Alzheimer's. People with diabetes can have a hard time keeping the right balance of insulin and blood sugar in their bloodstream. If your blood sugar levels drop too low, your body and brain don't have enough fuel to work as they should. This is called hypoglycemia. If it's severe, you can get confused doing even a basic daily task. You also can become clumsy, appear drunk, or maybe even faint."
What are symptoms of thyroid disease that looks like Alzheimer's?,"If you're depressed, you may find it hard to focus or remember things you need to do. In some people, especially those of advanced age, UTIs can cause a sudden onset of symptoms that look like Alzheimer's. It makes hormones that help your organs work and control how well your body uses food for fuel. If your thyroid is working too fast or too slow, it can affect your mental health. This can also make it hard for you to focus. And you may feel anxious or depressed. In severe cases, you can feel like you're losing touch with the real world."
What are fluoroquinolones?,"The fluoroquinolone antibiotics include ciprofloxacin ( Cipro), gemifloxacin ( Factive), levofloxacin ( Levaquin), moxifloxacin ( Avelox), and ofloxacin ( Floxin). This might include patients with allergies to other antibiotics or infections caused by hard-to treat, resistant bacteria."
What minerals are good to ingest when you are sick?,"Lean meat, poultry, fish, legumes, dairy, eggs, nuts, and seeds are good sources. Foods that have it provide nutrients like vitamins B6 and B12, both of which keep your immune system working like it should."
What should you drink if you have nausea?,"Your body uses it to build strength and keep what you already have. You can try chipped ice, juices, sports drinks, ginger ale, clear broths, gelatin, and ice pops. Start with small amounts, like 4 to 8 ounces at a time for adults and 1 ounce or less at a time for children. Only use clear liquids (clear broth, juice, lemon-lime soda). If you're not sure if it's clear, pour it in a clear glass bowl and try to read something through it. If you can't see the letters, it isn't clear."
Can nicotine lead to insulin resistance?,"Nicotine changes chemical processes in your cells so they don't respond to insulin and let it in, a condition called insulin resistance. Nicotine can also trigger your body to make more triglycerides, a type of fat linked to insulin resistance. And nicotine raises levels of hormones that fight insulin."
Why is low blood sugar bad for you?,"Nicotine can make your blood sugar level go up or down. That's a problem because when your blood glucose is too high for a few years, it could lead to heart disease and damage to your kidneys, nerves, and eyes."
How does smoking affect insulin resistance?,"Your cells need insulin so they can take glucose out of your blood and use it for energy. You could have signs of insulin resistance just an hour later. Studies show that people who have diabetes and smoke need larger doses of insulin to control their blood glucose. That's a problem because when your blood glucose is too high for a few years, it could lead to heart disease and damage to your kidneys, nerves, and eyes."
Can nicotine affect blood sugar?,"The chemical alters the way your body can use glucose, the sugar in your blood that fuels your cells. It could raise your odds of getting type 2 diabetes, and it can make your diabetes worse. On the flip side, nicotine may cause severe low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) for people who have diabetes and take insulin. When they can't, the glucose stays in your blood, and your blood sugar level goes up."
Who develops cholesterol problems?,"Most of your body's fat is triglycerides. Some families are genetically blessed with low total cholesterol or high levels of HDL (""good cholesterol""), regardless of diet or lifestyle. Other families inherit genes that increase their risk for high cholesterol. In these people, eating a diet high in saturated fat can significantly raise cholesterol levels. Stress can also raise blood cholesterol levels, especially since stress can lead to poor eating habits that may increase cholesterol intake."
What are ejaculation disorders?,"There are different types of ejaculation disorders, including: Premature ejaculation -- This refers to ejaculation that occurs before or very soon after penetration. Inhibited or retarded ejaculation -- This is when ejaculation is slow to occur. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward and into the bladder."
What is a sexual problem?,"The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Many men experience a sexual problem from time to time."
What causes sexual problems?,"These conditions include diabetes, heart and vascular (blood vessel) disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure, and alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma. Reduced libido can result from physical or psychological factors. Many cases of male sexual dysfunction can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems."
How common is sexual dysfunction?,Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. Increase communication with your partner.
Can sexual problems be cured?,"Sexual dysfunction can be a result of a physical or psychological condition. The outlook is good for dysfunction that is related to a treatable or reversible physical condition. However, when the problems are persistent, they can cause distress for the man and his partner, and have a negative impact on their relationship."
How is male sexual dysfunction treated?,"Sexual dysfunction can be a result of a physical or psychological condition. Treatment strategies may include the following: Medical treatment -- This involves treatment of any physical problem that may be contributing to a man's sexual dysfunction. Medications -- Medications, such as tadalafil ( Cialis), sildenafil ( Viagra) or vardenafil ( Levitra), may help improve sexual function in men by increasing blood flow to the penis. Promescent is a drug used to treat premature ejaculation. The topical spray is applied to the penis and contains lidocaine, reducing sensitivity and allowing for more ejaculation control. Hormones -- Men with low levels of testosterone may benefit from hormone supplementation (testosterone replacement therapy). Psychological therapy -- Therapy with a trained counselor can help a person address feelings of anxiety, fear, or guilt that may have an impact on sexual function. Mechanical aids -- Aids such as vacuum devices and penile implants may help men with erectile dysfunction. Education and communication -- Education about sex and sexual behaviors and responses may help a man overcome his anxieties about sexual performance. Open dialogue with your partner about your needs and concerns also helps to overcome many barriers to a healthy sex life."
When is surgery used for stage IV colon cancer?,"But in others, it may only ease symptoms. These treatments often can be used if your cancer has spread to the liver."
What is radiation?,"But in others, it may only ease symptoms. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells."
What are kinase inhibitors for stage IV colon cancer patients?,"Kinase inhibitors. To get a targeted therapy, you will visit a hospital or medical center once every 2 to 3 weeks. You take some of these drugs through your vein, but one comes in the form of a pill."
What are clinical trials for stage IV colon cancer patients?,There are several kinds of chemo drugs used to treat stage IV colon cancer. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you.
What is hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy?,You might get only chemo if you can't have surgery. Your doctor places a pump that delivers the chemo drug straight into your liver through an artery. Because the medicine doesn't go through your whole body -- just into your liver -- you can get a higher dose without having more side effects.
What is the difference between ablation and cryotherapy?,Surgery sometimes can be used if the cancer has spread to your liver or lungs. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. A CT or ultrasound scan will help your surgeon guide a thin probe to the tumor. The probe delivers high-energy radio waves to heat the tumor or very cold gas to freeze it.
How are nasal polyps treated?,"They may come back, though. If you know you have that allergy, ask your doctor to check for nasal polyps. She'll use a nasal endoscope, which is a tool with a magnifying lens or camera that provides a detailed view of your nose and sinuses. In some cases, your doctor may order more tests or take a small sample (a biopsy) of the polyp. If you need treatment, you'll probably start with a nasal corticosteroid spray. In many cases, that can shrink or even get rid of nasal polyps. So you may need to keep using a corticosteroid spray and get checkups with a nasal endoscope every now and then. In general, medications such as antihistamines and decongestants aren't great at managing nasal polyps."
What can you do to keep a healthy weight to manage diabetes?,So learning to relax is important in managing your diabetes. Exercise regularly.
Can a pancreas transplantation cure diabetes?,"But the reality is that there is no cure for diabetes -- neither type 1 diabetes nor type 2 diabetes. The more weight a person loses after surgery, the greater improvement in blood sugar control. Like anyone else who gets a transplant, the patient would need to take medicine for the rest of their life to help their body accept their new pancreas."
What do you need to know about the cabbage soup diet?,"But before you stock up on cabbage, know that this crash diet won't help you in the long run, and it doesn't give your body the nutrients it needs to stay healthy. A better bet is to aim to lose 1 to 2 pounds each week on a healthy, well-balanced diet. And if you follow the Cabbage Soup Diet for more than a week, you could run short on key nutrients."
What are some drawbacks of the cabbage soup diet?,"Limitations: Your menu options are severely limited on this diet. It gets very boring, very quickly. If you want to try it again, it's recommended that you wait 2 weeks first. You will need to make the cabbage soup and cook some of the vegetables recommended in the plan. Exercise: The cabbage soup diet doesn't include exercise, and working out at high levels isn't a great idea on such a low-calorie diet. Your body just won't have enough gas in the tank for exercise."
What is diabetes and what are the different types?,Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Type 2 diabetes is often a milder form of diabetes than type 1.
What is the result of diabetes?,"Nevertheless, type 2 diabetes can still cause major health complications, particularly in the smallest blood vessels in the body that nourish the kidneys, nerves, and eyes. Type 2 diabetes also increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. Because high blood sugar levels in a mother are circulated through the placenta to the baby, gestational diabetes must be controlled to protect the baby's growth and development."
What medical risks are associated with type 1 diabetes?,"Many of them stem from damage to the tiny blood vessels in your eyes (called diabetic retinopathy), nerves (diabetic neuropathy), and kidneys (diabetic nephropathy). Even more serious is the increased risk of heart disease and stroke. With gestational diabetes, risks to the unborn baby are even greater than risks to the mother."
What do all types of diabetes have in common?,"In people with type 1 diabetes, the damaged pancreas doesn't make insulin. The methods of injecting insulin include: Syringes Insulin pens that use pre-filled cartridges and a fine needle Jet injectors that use high pressure air to send a spray of insulin through the skin Insulin pumps that dispense insulin through flexible tubing to a catheter under the skin of the abdomen A periodic test called the A1 C blood test estimates glucose levels in your blood over the previous three months."
What are other names for type 2 diabetes?,"It used to be called juvenile-onset diabetes, because it often begins in childhood. Type 2 diabetes was also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes."
Who is at risk for developing type 2 diabetes?,"Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes, but with the epidemic of obese and overweight kids, more teenagers are now developing type 2 diabetes. Obese people have insulin resistance. With insulin resistance, the pancreas has to work overly hard to produce more insulin. But even then, there is not enough insulin to keep sugars normal."
Does gestational diabetes lead to other types of diabetes after pregnancy?,"Diabetes that's triggered by pregnancy is called gestational diabetes (pregnancy, to some degree, leads to insulin resistance). Having gestational diabetes does, however, put mothers at risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Up to 10% of women with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes. It can occur anywhere from a few weeks after delivery to months or years later."
What do all types of diabetes mellitus have in common?,"But either the amount made isn't enough for the body's needs, or the body's cells resist it. In people with type 1 diabetes, the damaged pancreas doesn't make insulin. But either the amount produced is not enough for the body's needs, or the body's cells are resistant to it. These types of diabetes account for only 1% to 5% of all cases of diabetes."
What is diabetes mellitus?,Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Type 2 diabetes is often a milder form of diabetes than type 1.
How does the body fight free radicals to prevent cancer?,"Antioxidants work by bolstering the body's defenses against potentially dangerous substances called free radicals. However antioxidants, such as selenium and beta-carotene, may help reinforce this protection. However, in clinical trials, neither of these agents has been shown to reduce cancer development. Studies have shown that antioxidants are best taken as foods as opposed to supplements. Some examples of antioxidants are carotene, beta-carotene, and lutein. Foods that are good sources of antioxidants include fruits, vegetables, and certain types of tea."
Should I pay attention to the labels when I buy food?,"As with any prepared food you buy, read the labels on supplements to be sure you're getting what you want. Here are some tips: Be sure the product you buy is fresh: Check expiration dates. The bottle should be sealed for your protection. If it isn't, or if the seal is broken, don't buy it. Look for a reputable manufacturer as quality can vary widely. If you're prone to stomach upset, capsules may be a better choice than tablets, which are harder for your system to absorb. Avoid supplements containing fillers, ingredients used to bulk up products so they ""look like more."" These include wheat, corn, and dairy products, which could cause digestive or allergic problems for some people. If fish oil is listed as a source of omega-3 essential fatty acids, the label should state that it has been produced in a manner that eliminates contaminants, particularly mercury. The FDA does regulate dietary supplements, but treats them like food rather than medications; unlike drug manufacturers, the makers of supplements don't have to show their products are safe or effective before selling them. The FDA can get a supplement removed from the market, though. And supplement manufacturers must maintain certain standards (called GMP) that are similar to those for pharmaceutical makers."
How can you get 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) naturally?,5- HTP is an amino acid. 5- HTP supplements may raise levels of serotonin in the brain.
What are benefits of 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) supplements?,"It is available as a supplement and is generally considered safe, although some contaminated supplements have caused dangerous side effects. 5- HTP supplements also seem to help with fibromyalgia symptoms. In some studies, it's eased pain, morning stiffness, and sleep problems. People take 5- HTP for other conditions, including insomnia, anxiety, and obesity. There's not enough evidence to know whether it works for these conditions."
What is 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)?,"5- HTP is related to serotonin, a brain chemical that affects mood, sleep, and pain. It is available as a supplement and is generally considered safe, although some contaminated supplements have caused dangerous side effects. Your body makes 5- HTP from tryptophan, another amino acid."
Who should not use 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) supplements?,"Children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take these supplements. Check with a doctor first if you take any other drugs, especially cough medicines, painkillers, or treatments for Parkinson's disease."
What are symptoms of nodular melanomas?,"Nodular melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It's a dangerous form of melanoma that grows quickly. What It looks like: A nodular melanoma can look like a mole, bug bite, or pimple. Often, it looks like a round black bump. But it can be other colors. But usually it appears on the parts of the body that get a lot of sun, such as your: Legs Torso (chest, back, belly) Arms Head What to do: Don't try to pop it. The skin may break open, but there's no pus inside. You'll just cause a wound. If you have a new growth or spot on your skin that doesn't go away in 5 days, see your doctor. You might not notice a nodular melanoma since these cancers don't follow the usual warning signs of melanomas. And it's rare, but about 5% of the time, they don't have an unusual color. They can be pink, tan, or flesh-toned. The melanoma is often solid in color with even borders."
Who gets nodular melanomas?,Nodular melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It's a dangerous form of melanoma that grows quickly. One main cause is the UV light from the daylight and tanning beds. But it's more common in men than women. The disease is most often found in men ages 50 and older. You're more likely to get the cancer if you have one or more of the following: A family member who has or had skin cancer Pale skin that burns easily More than a few unusual-looking moles A history of spending lots of time in the sun A dermatologist will check your skin.
What causes nodular melanomas?,"Nodular melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It's a dangerous form of melanoma that grows quickly. One main cause is the UV light from the daylight and tanning beds. Their rays can harm the skin's DNA. Although it's less common, they can also develop on parts of your body that aren't exposed to the sun. When the DNA in skin cells become damaged, new cells can grow out of control. This can lead to melanoma. Experts aren't exactly sure what causes this DNA damage and how it brings on cancer. It's probably due to a mix of your genes, lifestyle habits, and UV exposure. Melanomas develop in the cells that give your skin its color. Most of the time, they spread slowly in your skin's top layer. But in nodular melanoma, the cancer grows downward. It can get into tissues, bones, and lymph nodes within weeks or months. That's when the cancer is harder to treat."
What should I know about pleurisy?,"It affects a part of your body you may not have heard of: your pleura. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Your lungs are wrapped in a thin layer of tissue called pleura. They fit snugly within your chest, which is lined with another thin layer of pleura. These layers keep your bare lungs from rubbing up against the wall of your chest cavity every time that you breathe in. There's a bit of fluid within the very narrow space between the two layers of pleura to keep everything moving smoothly. When you're healthy, you never notice your pleura at work. An electrocardiogram of your heart might show that your chest pain is caused by a heart problem, not pleurisy."
Can you get Duane syndrome (DS) during pregnancy?,It happens when the nerves that control the eye muscles don't grow normally during pregnancy or are missing. This is when a baby's eye nerves and muscles start to develop.
How can you tell if you have  Duane syndrome (DS)?,"Most of the time, only one eye is affected -- usually the left one. There are three types of DS: Type 1: People with this form aren't able to move their affected eye out toward their ear. This is the most common kind of DS. It might happen all the time or just sometimes. Upshoot or downshoot: The affected eye sometimes looks up or down. Some people with DS also have double vision and headaches."
What causes Duane syndrome (DS)?,"Most of the time, only one eye is affected -- usually the left one. But it isn't clear what actually causes DS."
What is grading in prostate cancer?,The grade refers to the cancer's appearance and indicates how quickly a cancer is growing. Most pathologists assign a grade from 1 to 5 based on how the cancerous cells look compared to normal prostate cells. There is a 30% to 50% likelihood of finding prostate cancer in a later biopsy when high-grade PIN is initially discovered.
What do other test results in prostate cancer mean?,"The cancerous tissue looks very much like normal prostate cells. These results are often reported as ""suspicious"" and fall into one of two categories, either atypical or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PIN). PIN is often further divided into low grade and high grade. The significance of low-grade PIN in relation to prostate cancer remains unclear. Many men have it when they are young and never develop prostate cancer. Biopsy results that fall into either atypical or high-grade PIN are suspicious for the presence of prostate cancer in another portion of the gland. There is a 30% to 50% likelihood of finding prostate cancer in a later biopsy when high-grade PIN is initially discovered. For this reason, repeat biopsies are generally recommended."
What medicines can you take for Gaucher disease?,"Most adults and kids with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease can get this kind of treatment. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and muscle relaxers may also help with pain."
What are the treatments for Gaucher disease?,"There are a lot of ways to ease the symptoms of Gaucher disease. If you or your child has mild symptoms, it's possible you won't need any treatments at all. Most adults and kids with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease can get this kind of treatment. It replaces or adds to enzymes that your liver or spleen can't make anymore. If you're an adult with type 1 Gaucher, you can take pills that cut down on fats that can build up in your liver, spleen, or bone marrow."
what are treatments for Gaucher disease if drugs haven't helped?,Most adults and kids with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease can get this kind of treatment. A blood transfusion can boost your red blood cell count so you feel better.
What lifestyle changes may help with Gaucher disease?,"Most adults and kids with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease can get this kind of treatment. It may not work well for people who metabolize -- or break down -- the drug too quickly. Both kids and adults with Gaucher should eat a healthy diet with foods rich in vitamin D and calcium to help keep bones strong, and get regular exercise. Vitamin D, calcium, or other supplements may help ease Gaucher symptoms too. Your doctor may recommend them if he thinks you're not getting enough in your diet."
What should you do in the last days or hours of death of your loved one?,"It may upset them and make them argue and fight with you. When death is within days or hours, your loved one may: Not want food or drink Stop peeing and having bowel movements Grimace, groan, or scowl from pain You may notice their: Eyes tear or glaze over Pulse and heartbeat are irregular or hard to feel or hear Body temperature drops Skin on their knees, feet, and hands turns a mottled bluish-purple (often in the last 24 hours) Breathing is interrupted by gasping and slows until it stops entirely If they're not already unconscious, your loved one may drift in and out. Stay with them. Sometimes medication helps. The room should be well lit, but not bright. Make it as quiet and peaceful as possible. Constantly assure them that you're there. Ironically, a loved one may also become clear-headed in their final hours."

There is drainage or bleeding on the white part of the eye or drainage from the eye. After 1 or 2 days, apply warm compresses to the bruised area instead."
How is breast cancer detected and diagnosed?,"The chances of developing the disease increase with age. Many breast cancer experts, including the American Cancer Society, recommend beginning routine screening for breast cancer with a mammogram at age 45. Others suggest waiting till age 50. Your doctor may recommend starting earlier than age 45, depending on your individual risk factors. The purpose of a mammogram is to find abnormalities that are too small to be seen or felt. However, mammograms will not detect all breast cancers, which is why physical breast exams are very important."
How can psychiatric evaluation help in the diagnosis of dementia?,"There's no single test that will tell your doctor if you have dementia. It's a process. Psychiatric evaluation: Your doctor will ask questions about your mood and sense of well-being to see if depression or another mental health condition might be causing symptoms of dementia. She'll also probably ask about any behaviors that are causing concern: When do they happen, and how long do they last? And she'll talk with you about your relationships with your spouse, children, or friends."
How can neurological tests help in the diagnosis of dementia?,"There's no single test that will tell your doctor if you have dementia. It's a process. Neurological tests: Your doctor will test your balance, reflexes, eye movements, and see how well your sense work. To do this, she might ask you to push or pull her hands using your arms or to stand with your eyes closed and touch your nose. To check your reflexes, your doctor may tap a small rubber hammer against parts of your body and watch how you respond."
Why do my breasts hurt?,"It can be troubling, too -- it's very common to wonder if what you're feeling might be a sign of breast cancer. Doctors call breast pain âmastalgia.â It's important to track the cause of it. But know that pain in either or both of your breasts in itself isn't a sign of breast cancer. Breast tenderness and other discomfort can happen for lots of different reasons. Yours might be linked to another issue if: Your pain feels like soreness, burning, or tightness Discomfort is constant (or unpredictable) Pain seems to affect one breast in a particular area You've passed menopause This pain feels like it's coming from your breasts."
How can you tell if you have support issues relative to breast pain?,"Fibrous tissue (breast tissue that's scar-like or ropey) and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) form in your breasts. Certain prescription meds, as well as hormone medications, can cause breast pain. Reduction surgery can help, but it, too, can cause pain if tissue is damaged during the operation. A supportive, sturdy bra can help keep your breasts in place. Wearing a sports bra to bed and when exercising can also help."
What hormone levels trigger breast pain?,"Doctors aren't sure what triggers breast pain.

Should I take it as a pill, powder, or liquid? Which form of the vitamin (vitamin D2 or D3, for instance) is the best? Are there any side effects? What are the best brands of this supplement in terms of quality, safety, and how well they work? Can I take it along with my other medications? Should I avoid any foods?

What are some tips for buying vitamins and supplements?,"When you're ready to purchase supplements, keep these tips in mind: Look for evidence about how well the product works in scientific studies from credible publications. Choose brands labeled with the NSF International, US Pharmacopeia, Underwriters Laboratory, or Consumer Lab seal. These verify that the product actually contains the ingredients that the label says it does, and that the product doesn't have any potentially harmful ingredients. Be wary of supplements made outside the United States. Many aren't regulated, and some may have toxic ingredients."
Which vitamin form should I choose?,"Will I need to stop taking it if I have to have surgery? Vitamins and supplements come in many forms, like pills, liquids, or powders.

What is progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis?,"The way the disease changes and gets worse is different for each of the three types of MS: Relapsing-remitting MS: People with this type have attacks when their symptoms get worse, called relapses, followed by full, partial, or no recovery. Most people have this type when they're first diagnosed with MS. Secondary-progressive MS: People who get this type usually start with relapsing-remitting MS. Over time, symptoms stop coming and going and begin getting steadily worse."
Are the symptoms for multiple sclerosis different for everyone?,"The symptoms it causes and when they flare up vary not only between people but also throughout one person's life. This means it can be hard for doctors to diagnose someone with the condition. They might say you ""probably"" or ""possibly"" have MS. The way the disease changes and gets worse is different for each of the three types of MS: Relapsing-remitting MS: People with this type have attacks when their symptoms get worse, called relapses, followed by full, partial, or no recovery."

Choose foods with high water content, like watermelon, lettuce, and broccoli. Suck on ice chips. If you can't stomach the idea of drinking or eating, try ice chips. A few at a time will give you a little liquid. It takes a lot to add up to a glass of water, but every little bit helps. Log how many ounces you drink, and record how many times you throw up or have diarrhea. This will help if you have to call your doctor about symptoms."

Who should get an intrathecal baclofen for multiple sclerosis?,"You need only tiny doses for the drug to work. If it works, you can decide with your doctor and family members if you should have a baclofen pump system implanted."
What is the intrathecal baclofen pump system for multiple sclerosis?,"This part of your body is filled with the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord and nerve roots. A surgeon puts the device -- a round metal disc, about 1 inch thick and 3 inches around -- under the skin of your belly near your waistline. The pump stores and releases the right amount of medicine through the catheter. A tiny motor moves the medication from the pump through the catheter. Your treatment team can use a small computer outside your body to send messages to the pump and make adjustments in the dose, rate, and timing of the medication. You can also turn the system off when you don't need it."

Stretching may also help ease constipation, and yoga may, too."
How can exercise help with constipation?,"Exercise helps constipation by lowering the time it takes food to move through the large intestine. Plus, aerobic exercise speeds up your breathing and heart rate. This helps to stimulate the natural squeezing (or contractions) of muscles in your intestines. Intestinal muscles that squeeze better will help move stools out quickly."
Why do people take ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)?,"EDTA is a molecule called a chelating agent. EDTA is sometimes prescribed by doctors to clean toxic metals, such as lead, from the blood. In those cases it is given through an IV. EDTA is also an ingredient in some prescription cancer-fighting medicines."
Does ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) work?,"EDTA is a molecule called a chelating agent. There is no scientific evidence to support this. Preliminary studies show that intravenous EDTA therapy under physician supervision may help patients who have had a heart attack, particularly if they have diabetes. However, more study is needed to prove this. For instance, it is sometimes added to: Sodas Canned fruits and vegetables Non-nutritive sweeteners Condiments such as mayonnaise Salad dressings The FDA says EDTA is considered safe for use in foods in the U. S. The most common side effect of EDTA is burning at the IV site."

Stress likely raises your chances of getting them. These are also called fever blisters and are caused by the herpes simplex virus. They're filled with fluid and often show up on or around your lips."
Do experts agree of the effects of ADHD medications on a child's growth?,"One of the most talked about -- and controversial -- effects of these medications is on children's growth. Some researchers have suggested that it's not the drugs, but the ADHD itself that affects children's growth. The early studies on ADHD medications and children's growth lasted only a few months, making it difficult to determine whether the growth lag would be permanent."
How can ADHD medications affect your child?,"One of the most talked about -- and controversial -- effects of these medications is on children's growth. After a few studies found that kids taking ADHD medications don't grow as tall as their peers, many parents began to worry that the same drugs that were helping their kids focus were also stunting their growth. It's natural to worry about your child's size. But before you switch or stop ADHD medications, it's important for you to know what the research has shown about the effects of these medications on children's growth. One study showed that children with ADHD who aren't taking stimulant drugs are actually bigger than kids without ADHD. Researchers first made the connection between ADHD drugs and children's growth back in the early 1970s."
How do I know if ADHD medication is affecting my child's growth and what should I do?,"Researchers have a few theories about how ADHD drugs might affect a child's size. If your child is taking ADHD medication and is benefiting from the drugs, the improvement in behavior may outweigh any short-term effects on growth. That's something you need to discuss with your pediatrician or psychiatrist."
What should parents do to lessen the effects of ADHD medications on child growth?,"Researchers have a few theories about how ADHD drugs might affect a child's size. If your child is taking ADHD medication and is benefiting from the drugs, the improvement in behavior may outweigh any short-term effects on growth. That's something you need to discuss with your pediatrician or psychiatrist. While your child is taking ADHD medications, the doctor should keep careful track of his or her growth. You might need to adjust your child's diet, adding more energy-dense, nutritious foods and snacks to balance out any weight loss that's occurring. In severe cases, medications that increase the appetite may be used for a short period of time."

After a few studies found that kids taking ADHD medications don't grow as tall as their peers, many parents began to worry that the same drugs that were helping their kids focus were also stunting their growth. It's natural to worry about your child's size. Another theory is that ADHD medicine targets metabolic or growth factors that could affect a child's growth."
What is xanthan gum?,"It has different effects in these products: It can add thickness, keep textures from changing, and hold ingredients in place. These include: Tablets that slowly break down in the body Liquid drops for the eyes Xanthan gum is produced by fermenting a carbohydrate (a substance that contains sugar) with Xanthomonas campestris bacteria, then processing it. Research on the health effects of xanthan gum is limited. When baking, some people who avoid gluten mix xanthan gum with gluten-free flour to achieve the same effects. Some people who have trouble swallowing add a product called Simply Thick -- which contains xanthan gum -- to foods and drinks to make them easier to swallow. Xanthan gum is a food additive. Some supermarkets also carry xanthan gum alongside other ingredients for baking or in the natural foods area."
Do biologics work best if you take them on a regular schedule?,"Your doctor may also prescribe other medicines that work faster to help you in the meantime. If it happens to you, tell your doctor."

The goal is to find the best medicines for you as quickly as possible. He'll probably switch you to another biologic or add another type of RA drug, like methotrexate or sulfasalazine, so your treatment works better. Some people get more help from biologics than others. Experts can't predict who'll respond well and who won't. But they know that people who get treatment in the earlier stages of RA tend to do better than those who've had the disease for many years. Biologics also work best if you take them on a regular schedule. If you can't do that due to side effects or the cost of the drugs, ask your doctor about your options."
What questions might my pediatrician ask during my child's 15-month checkup?,"Your baby has now entered the toddler years, and you're in for quite a ride! How's your child's appetite?

Keep offering new foods. If your child doesn't like a food one week, she may love it the next. It takes many times for a child to like some foods, so don't give up! Small children like to imitate their parents. If your child sees you eating a variety of foods, she may do the same. Stick to mostly unprocessed foods such as fruits and vegetables. These provide great nutrition for your baby's growing brain and body. Whole grains are also a good source of nutrition. Keep cutting your child's food into small pieces, staying mindful of potential choking hazards."
How many treats should I give my pet?,"Many pet owners give these little extras as rewards -- or to show their love for their dogs or cats -- without thinking about the number of calories that are in each handout.

What plays a role in susceptibility for Graves' disease?,"But in Graves' disease, a malfunction in the body's immune system releases abnormal antibodies that mimic TSH. Heredity and other characteristics seem to play a role in determining susceptibility. Studies show, for example, that if one identical twin contracts Graves' disease, there is a 20% likelihood that the other twin will get it, too. Also, women are more likely than men to develop the disease. And smokers who develop Graves' disease are more prone to eye problems than nonsmokers with the disease.

What causes encopresis?,"Rarely, encopresis is caused by an anatomic abnormality or disease that the child is born with. In the great majority of cases, encopresis develops as a result of chronic (long-standing) constipation. However, each person has his or her own schedule for bowel movements, and many healthy people do not have a bowel movement every day. A constipated child might pass a bowel movement every third day or less often. Constipation implies not only infrequent bowel movements, but also having difficulty or experiencing pain when doing so."
What are other treatments for encopresis?,"Most cases of encopresis respond to the treatment regimen outlined above. It is used rarely and under close supervision in children. For encopresis, fiber supplements and certain foods, such as fruit juices and prunes, can have a laxative effect. These foods and juices function as osmotic laxatives. They all contain various sugars that are not efficiently absorbed by the intestinal lining, thus increasing the amount of water in the colon. Given in large enough doses, all of these foods and juices are very effective laxatives. The best way to prevent encopresis is to prevent constipation in the first place."
What is the final step in treating encopresis?,"Over time, the child with encopresis may also develop incoordination of the muscles used to pass bowel movements. This step is just as critical as the first two steps and must not be abandoned just because the soiling has improved after the previous steps."
What is encopresis?,"This stool or fecal soiling usually has a physical origin and is involuntary -- the child doesn't do it on purpose. However, each person has his or her own schedule for bowel movements, and many healthy people do not have a bowel movement every day. More than 80% of children with encopresis have experienced constipation or painful defecation in the past."
How are severe cases of encopresis treated?,"Eventually, looser, partly formed stool from higher up in the intestine leaks around the large collection of harder, more formed stool at the bottom of the colon (rectum) and then leaks out of the anus (the opening from the rectum to the outside of the body). Evacuation can be accomplished in the following ways: Give an enema or series of enemas: An enema pushes fluid into the rectum."
What are concerns about using laxatives for encopresis?,"Laxatives do not stop working if they are used every day for a long time. Osmotic laxatives: These laxatives contain agents that are not efficiently absorbed by the intestinal lining. Since all osmotic laxatives work by increasing the amount of water in the colon, it is important that your child drinks lots of fluid while taking any of these laxatives."
What is the best way to prevent encopresis?,"Drinking plenty of fluid helps keep stools soft and may help prevent constipation in the first place. Make sure the child gets a varied diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grain breads and cereals. The child should drink water and other fluids frequently and be physically active every day. Finally, make sure the child has a regular time every day when he or she sits on the toilet. After a meal is the best time for this."
How does encopresis develop?,"This âholding inâ becomes a habit that often remains long after the constipation or pain with passing bowel movements has resolved. As more and more stool collects in the child's lower intestine (colon), the colon slowly stretches (sometimes called megacolon). Over time, the child with encopresis may also develop incoordination of the muscles used to pass bowel movements. In most cases, this is not the case. Children with encopresis rarely need surgery."
Who is more likely to be affected by encopresis?,"Many more boys than girls experience encopresis; approximately 80% of affected children are boys. Generally, it takes longer in younger children than in older children."
Should I tell my sex partners about my psoriasis?,"Psoriasis can change the way you feel about your body, especially with a romantic partner.

How can the thyroid hormone cause dry eyes?,"These chemical messengers travel all over the body, so it's no surprise they can also affect your eyes. Changes in your levels of thyroid hormone, which is made by the thyroid gland in your neck, can also cause dry eye. The changes can be due to a thyroid-related autoimmune disease. If you have one, the immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- mistakenly thinks your thyroid gland is an enemy and attacks it. For instance, Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that's linked in its early stages with high thyroid levels, but over time or after treatment may have low thyroid levels. People who have it may have trouble closing their eyelids, don't blink often enough, and also can't keep their tear levels up. The eyes may actually bulge forward. All of these problems can lead to dry eye. Hashimoto's disease is another autoimmune disorder that causes low thyroid levels and dry eye."

Whether you're a man or woman, lower androgen levels may affect how well certain glands make tears or the oily film that keeps the surface of your eye moist."
How does insulin cause dry eyes?,"These chemical messengers travel all over the body, so it's no surprise they can also affect your eyes. If you have diabetes, either type 1 or type 2, there's a good chance you'll also get dry eye. The reason may have to do with the amount of insulin you have. Low insulin levels make it harder for your lacrimal gland to make tears. Taking insulin may reverse some of these problems."
How do hormones cause dry eyes?,"These chemical messengers travel all over the body, so it's no surprise they can also affect your eyes. It does seem that women who take only estrogen are more likely to get dry eye, while those who take a combo of estrogen and progesterone (another female sex hormone) are less likely to get it. The changes can be due to a thyroid-related autoimmune disease."

Is fiber a good way to treat constipation that comes from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"But some people may need more help from bulk-forming laxatives. They add soluble fiber to your stool, which makes it easier to pass by absorbing more water in your intestines. Make sure you drink plenty of water when you take one, though. These laxatives include methylcellulose ( Citrucel), polycarbophil ( Fiber Con), and psyllium ( Metamucil). These pull water back into your colon, which softens your stool so it's easier to get it out of your body. When you take them for a long time, your body can get used to them so that they won't work for you anymore.

Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, chills and fever. If You Need Corticosteroids These are strong, anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors usually prescribe them only if other treatments don't work, or if the condition is severe. Examples of steroids include dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, and prednisone."
Do children with rheumatoid arthritis fully recover?,About 30% of all children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have this type. Treatment usually includes medications along with exercise.
What is pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis?,Four or fewer joints are involved. About half of all children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have this type. It usually affects large joints like the knees. Girls under age 8 are most likely to get it. Lots of children with this condition will outgrow it by adulthood.
What is the cause of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis?,"The inflammation can cause redness, swelling, warmth, and soreness in the joints. Researchers don't know exactly why it happens. But they think it's a two-step process. First, something in a child's genes makes them more likely to get it. Then something else, like a virus, triggers the arthritis itself. This type of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is usually symmetrical. â Biologicâ Drugs for Your Immune System These drugs are genetically engineered to work on the immune system."
Is weight related to juvenile arthritis?,"They often have a more severe form of the condition. Check with your doctor about which ones are appropriate for children. Others gain too much weight because they have problems being active, or because of side effects from medication. Extra weight is hard on the joints."
Are oral health problems related to juvenile arthritis?,"Dentists can recommend special toothbrushes and floss to help children take care of their mouths. If the lower jaw doesn't develop correctly, it can cause an overbite."
Are there different types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis?,"Doctors call this pauciarticular JRA. Some children with this type have special proteins in the blood called antinuclear antibodies. If your child has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, encourage her to get out there and be active."
"To help prevent heart disease, how often and how long should I exercise?","Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, is one of the best things you can do for yourself. If you're not active now, check in with your doctor before you start."
Why should I exercise to help prevent heart disease?,"If you're not active now, check in with your doctor before you start. She'll let you know what you can do safely. If you take any prescription medicines, ask her if you need to adjust them when you start exercising. While the more exercise you can do, the better, any amount is good for you. What's convenient for you is important, too."
Iâm exercising to prevent heart disease. How can I stick with it?,"Ban boredom. Pick a variety of activities that you like. Use music to keep you entertained. Commit. You won't always feel like it, and you'll find all sorts of excuses not to do it. You'll need to make a decision ahead of time and ignore that impulse and exercise anyway. Socialize. Working out is more fun if you have a friend with you. Stay within your budget. Don't buy expensive equipment or health club memberships unless you know you'll use them."
What will your doctor prescribe to treat herpes in your eye?,"Your doctor will prescribe antiviral eye drops, pills, or both. Take what he gives you for as long as he says to take it. Your eye might start to look or feel better soon, but the infection could come back if you stop treatment too soon. He might also give you steroid eye drops. They can control the disease if you get them at the right time, but they can also raise eye pressure. You'll need regular office visits during treatment so the doctor can keep track of it. You could also get an eye drop that keeps your pupil dilated (open). It will prevent spasms in your eye muscles and ease your pain. It's rare, but if you have the kind of virus that causes shingles, your eye could hurt for weeks or months. If that happens, your doctor might try other options, like sending you to a chronic pain specialist."
What are side effects of using fiber for constipation?,"Abdominal cramping, bloating, or gas can occur when abruptly increasing or changing your dietary fiber intake. Gradually increase fiber intake. Also, fiber can reduce your body's absorption of some drugs, so always take your medications at least one hour before -- or two hours after -- consuming fiber."
How does deep brain stimulation work?,"Deep Brain Stimulation Also called ""thalamic stimulation,"" deep brain stimulation is a way to inactivate the thalamus without destroying a part of the brain. The pacemaker-like device generates the tiny electrical impulses that aren't painful to the patient. These shocks alter electrical ""messages"" going through the thalamus. Deep brain stimulation provides moderate relief for approximately 90% of patients."
What is the disadvantage of thalamotomy when compared to deep brain stimulation?,"Thalamotomy Thalamotomy is a surgery for Essential Tremor that destroys a small part of a structure in the brain called the thalamus. Common, but temporary, side effects of thalamotomy include: Confusion Weakness Disturbed speech Balance problems The major disadvantage of thalamotomy is the permanent destruction of this area of the brain, which may limit future treatment options, and thalamotomy should only be performed under rare circumstances. Deep brain stimulation, described below, is safer and more effective."
How can knowing your triggers help with migraines?,"Migraines can be tough wherever they happen. Triggers are different for everyone. When you know which things can start your migraines, you can try to avoid them. If you can't stay away from them, at least you'll know to be prepared for when they happen."
How can acetaminophen (Tylenol) help with treating cervical disc disease?,"Neck pain is one of the main symptoms of cervical disc disease, in which discs between vertebrae become herniated or deteriorate, sometimes pinching nerves. Several different drugs, from pain relievers to anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, can help ease your neck pain while you heal. Research shows that regular acetaminophen use can damage the liver, even in people who take the drug at the recommended dose. To make sure you're using acetaminophen as safely as possible, follow the directions carefully and don't take any more than the label suggests and your doctor recommends. Avoid using alcohol while taking acetaminophen to minimize the risks to your liver."
How can muscle relaxants help with treating cervical disc disease?,"Neck pain is one of the main symptoms of cervical disc disease, in which discs between vertebrae become herniated or deteriorate, sometimes pinching nerves. Several different drugs, from pain relievers to anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, can help ease your neck pain while you heal. Baclofen and other muscle relaxants calm muscle tightness, and some research suggests they can relieve neck pain within the first few days of an acute injury. When using these drugs, watch out for side effects such as drowsiness, dependence, and urinary retention. These drugs are best used short term under a doctor's guidance."
Does the rate of burning calories affect how you lose weight?,"Try cottage cheese with fruit, eggs with whole-wheat toast, or Greek yogurt with a banana. Other things that can affect how you burn calories: Getting older. Your metabolism slows down about 2%-8% every decade. That may be from decreased muscle mass. Eating too little. It sounds strange, but the truth is, if you skip meals or follow a very low-calorie diet, it can backfire by making you burn calories more slowly. Lift weights to boost your lean muscle mass. Your metabolism may slow and you won't burn calories as fast as you'd like. How your thyroid affects your metabolism, energy, and weight is complicated."
Does eating too close to bedtime affect how you lose weight?,"Try to eat dinner at least 3 hours before you go to sleep. Be careful about snacking after supper. You take in more calories than you realize when you nibble while you watch TV or use the computer. You may also be tempted to eat unhealthy foods like ice cream or potato chips. That makes it harder to exercise. For instance, you might have trouble losing weight if you take drugs for: Allergies Birth control Depression Diabetes Epilepsy High blood pressure Bipolar disorder Schizophrenia If you have one of these conditions and weight is a problem for you, talk to your doctor."
How does sleep affect how you lose weight?,"It could make a difference in how you lose weight. Your metabolism may slow and you won't burn calories as fast as you'd like. You may also have less energy when you don't get enough sleep. That makes it harder to exercise. When you're tired, you're more likely to make poor diet choices, like choosing sweets over fruit. In a recent study, people who didn't get enough sleep ate about 300 more calories per day than those who got more rest."
Does being stressed out affect how you lose weight?,"It could be. It can make you reach for high-calorie, high-fat foods. Your body also tends to store more fat when you're stressed out. To reduce stress, try exercise or meditation."
What causes heartburn in pregnancy?,"Pregnancy hormones can cause the lower esophageal sphincter (the muscular valve between the stomach and esophagus) to relax, allowing stomach acids to flow back up into the esophagus. In addition, the enlarged uterus can crowd the abdomen, pushing stomach acids upward. Although it's rare, gallstones can also cause heartburn during pregnancy. Avoid fried, spicy, or rich (fatty) foods or any foods that seem to cause relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and increase the risk of heartburn."
What cosmetic procedures are used to treat port-wine stains?,"Port-wine stains are caused by abnormal development of blood vessels (capillaries) and last a lifetime. Doctors have tried many ways to treat port-wine stains, including radiation, tattooing, freezing, dermabrasion, or sclerotherapy. Laser treatment is the preferred treatment because it is the only method that destroys capillaries in the skin without causing damage to the rest of the skin."
What are the types of counseling that can help with Parkinson's disease?,"Parkinson's disease, as with many chronic illnesses, will affect you both physically and mentally. Who will be included in your treatment (you alone, family members, others with similar problems). The following list briefly describes common types of counseling. Crisis intervention counseling. This is where you meet one-on-one with a counselor. If you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or grief in dealing with your Parkinson's this type of counseling may be appropriate. Family therapy. Group therapy. In group therapy, you join a group to discuss problems together. Residential treatment. These groups usually meet regularly without a therapist or counselor."
What are the fluoride levels in drinking water?,"This was fluoride that occurred naturally in the ground water. Natural fluoride levels above the currently recommended range for drinking water may increase the risk for severe fluorosis. In communities where natural levels exceed 2 parts per million, the CDC recommends that parents give children water from other sources. Prompted by concerns that children may be getting too much fluoride, the Health and Human Services Department in January 2011 lowered its recommended level of fluoride in drinking water. And the Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing its rules on the upper limit of fluoride levels in drinking water."
How can you tell if your child got a lot of fluoride in a short period of time?,"A major cause of fluorosis is the inappropriate use of fluoride-containing dental products such as toothpaste and mouth rinses. If a child ingests a large amount of fluoride in a short period of time, it may cause symptoms such as: Nausea Diarrhea Vomiting Abdominal pain Although fluoride toxicity usually doesn't have serious consequences, it sends several hundred children to emergency rooms each year."
How common is fluorosis?,"In more severe cases, however, the teeth may have: Stains ranging from yellow to dark brown Surface irregularities Pits that are highly noticeable Fluorosis first attracted attention in the early 20th Century. Researchers were surprised by the high prevalence of what was called â Colorado Brown Stainâ on the teeth of native-born residents of Colorado Springs. The stains were caused by high levels of fluoride in the local water supply. This was fluoride that occurred naturally in the ground water. People with these stains also had an unusually high resistance to dental cavities. This sparked a movement to introduce fluoride into public water supplies at a level that could prevent cavities but without causing fluorosis. Fluorosis affects nearly one in every four Americans ages 6 to 49. It's most prevalent in those ages 12 to 15. The vast majority of cases are mild, and only about 2% are considered âmoderate.â Less than 1% are âsevere.â But researchers have also observed that since the mid-1980s, the prevalence of fluorosis in children ages 12 to 15 has increased. Although fluorosis is not a disease, its effects can be psychologically distressing and difficult to treat. Parental vigilance can play an important role in preventing fluorosis. Severe."
What do the side effects of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer depend on?,"Several new chemotherapy drugs also are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer that has spread. Because the mechanism of chemotherapy is to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells, it also kills other rapidly dividing healthy cells in our bodies, such as the membranes lining the mouth, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, the hair follicles, and the bone marrow. Although it may take some time, side effects related to chemotherapy will resolve when chemotherapy is stopped."
What chemotherapy drugs are used for colorectal cancer?,"Chemotherapy can be given in a variety of situations: Palliative chemotherapy is used when colorectal cancer is advanced and has already spread to different parts of the body. It is used in combination with leucovorin (a vitamin), which makes 5- FU more effective. 5- FU is given intravenously. A pill form of capecitabine ( Xeloda) is changed to 5- FU when it reaches the tumor. Xeloda is also being used as adjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant therapy with radiation in patients with rectal cancers to heighten the effect of radiation. Other drugs include irinotecan ( Camptosar) and oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin). These drugs are usually combined with 5- FU or Xeloda after surgery or in the advanced setting. Several new chemotherapy drugs also are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer that has spread. These include panitumumab ( Vectibix), cetuximab ( Erbitux), bevacizumab ( Avastin), ramucirumab ( Cyramza), and aflibercept ( Zaltrap), and are usually given along with 5- FU, plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin, for metastatic colorectal cancer. Regorafenib ( Stivarga) is another new drug that can be taken orally as a single agent after the other drugs have stopped working."
What is chemotherapy for colorectal cancer?,"Each drug works against a specific cancer, and each drug has specific doses and schedules for taking it. Chemotherapy can be given in a variety of situations: Palliative chemotherapy is used when colorectal cancer is advanced and has already spread to different parts of the body. The surgery may not eliminate all the cancer cells, so the adjuvant chemotherapy treatment is used to kill any that may have been missed, such as cells that may have metastasized or spread to the liver. 5- FU is given intravenously."
When is adjuvant chemotherapy used for colorectal cancer?,"The surgery may not eliminate all the cancer cells, so the adjuvant chemotherapy treatment is used to kill any that may have been missed, such as cells that may have metastasized or spread to the liver. 5- FU is given intravenously."
What should I consider before taking an herbal product for diabetes?,"If you experience side effects such as nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, insomnia, diarrhea, or skin rashes, stop taking the herbal product and notify your doctor immediately. Look for scientific-based sources of information."
How do doctors monitor prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels for prostate cancer?,"If you are diagnosed with prostate cancer, your doctor will probably evaluate several factors to determine how aggressive it is. PSA continues to be the primary marker of how the disease is progressing or responding to treatment. Several recent studies indicate that PSA doubling time -- the time it takes for a patient's PSA level to double -- predicts how aggressive the cancer is. The faster the PSA level doubles, the more aggressive the cancer."
Are there different kinds of carbs?,"It's a lot more than just pasta and bread. All starchy foods, sugars, fruit, milk, and yogurt are rich in carbs, too. Make sure you count them all, not just the obvious ones. You'll need to know your ""insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio,"" or the number of carbs one unit of insulin will cover."
Should I pay attention to my carb intake if I have diabetes?,"If you have diabetes, keep track of how many you eat with a few simple tricks. Your doses may change, depending on the amount of carbs you ate at a meal and the difference between your target blood sugar level and your actual reading."
"If I carb count, can I eat whatever I want if I have diabetes?","All starchy foods, sugars, fruit, milk, and yogurt are rich in carbs, too. Make sure you count them all, not just the obvious ones. Measuring cups and a food scale when you eat at home will help you be accurate. Make healthy choices."
How can I maintain the correct amount of carb intake per meal if I have diabetes?,"Most adults with diabetes aim for 45-60 grams of carbs per meal and 15-20 grams per snack. That number may go up or down, depending on how active you are and the medicines you take, so check with your doctor or a registered dietitian. Your doses may change, depending on the amount of carbs you ate at a meal and the difference between your target blood sugar level and your actual reading."
How is a colonoscopy used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease?,"Ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon or large intestine. A colonoscopy is similar to a sigmoidoscopy, except that the doctor will use a colonoscope, a longer flexible tube, to examine the entire colon. At the end of the procedure, the pictures are downloaded from the receiver onto a computer."
How is a barium X-ray used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease?,"You swallow a chalky white solution that coats the intestinal tract so it will be visible on X-rays. If a barium study is used to check the lower GI tract, you will be given an enema containing barium and asked to hold it in while X-rays are taken of the rectum and colon. Abnormalities caused by either Crohn's or ulcerative colitis may show up in these X-rays. If you have upper GI symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, a doctor will use an endoscope, a narrow, flexible tube with a camera and light, that will be inserted through the mouth -- to examine your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, which is the first part of your small intestine."
What does medical treatment for inflammatory bowel disease involve?,"With this approach, the least harmful drugs or drugs that are only taken for a short period of time are used first. If they fail to provide relief, drugs from a higher step are used. Treatment typically begins with aminosalicylates, which are aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drugs such as balsalazide ( Colazal), mesalamine ( Asacol, Apriso, Lialda, Pentasa), olsalazine ( Dipentum), and sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine). Mesalamine can be taken orally or be administered as a rectal suppository or enema to treat ulcerative colitis. Because they are anti-inflammatory, they are effective in both relieving symptoms of a flare-up and maintaining remission. The doctor may also prescribe anti diarrheal agents, antispasmodics, and acid suppressants for symptom relief. You should not take anti-diarrheal agents without a doctor's advice. These medications are not used in acute flare-ups, because they may take as long as 2 to 3 months to take action."
How are biologic therapies used for inflammatory bowel disease?,"When there is less or no inflammation, the person usually is without symptoms and the disease is said to be in remission. Other anti- TNF agents approved for Crohn's disease are adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, and certolizumab ( Cimzia). An alternative to anti- TNF treatment for Crohn's disease are biologics that target integrin, two of which are natalizumab ( Tysabri) and vedolizumab ( Entyvio). Another drug, ustekinumab ( Stelara), blocks IL-12 and IL-23. Adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), certolizumab ( Cimzia), golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria), Infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), and infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra) are some of the anti- TNF drugs currently approved by the FDA for ulcerative colitis."
What is inflammatory bowel disease?,"It has often been thought of as an autoimmune disease, but research suggests that the chronic inflammation may not be due to the immune system attacking the body itself. Instead, it is a result of the immune system attacking a harmless virus, bacteria, or food in the gut, causing inflammation that leads to bowel injury. They include: Abdominal cramps and pain Diarrhea that may be bloody Severe urgency to have a bowel movement Fever Weight loss Loss of appetite Iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss IBD can lead to several serious complications in the intestines, including: Profuse intestinal bleeding from the ulcers Perforation, or rupture of the bowel Narrowing - called a stricture -- and obstruction of the bowel; found in Crohn's Fistulae (abnormal passages) and perianal disease, disease in the tissue around the anus; these conditions are more common in Crohn's than in ulcerative colitis."
How is capsule endoscopy used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease?,"You swallow a small capsule that has a camera in it. Pictures are taken of the esophagus, stomach and small bowel and then sent to a receiver you wear on a belt. At the end of the procedure, the pictures are downloaded from the receiver onto a computer. The camera is passed through your body into the toilet. If you have Crohn's disease, especially if it's accompanied by a complication such as perianal disease (diseased tissue around the anus), the doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to be taken with your other medicines."
When are antibiotics used to treat inflammatory bowel disease?,"Antibiotics are less commonly used for ulcerative colitis. If you have Crohn's disease and require surgery, your doctor will discuss your options with you."
Can diet and nutrition help or cure lupus?,"In general, people with lupus should aim for a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It should also include moderate amounts of meats, poultry, and oily fish. It can also result from medications that cause stomach upset or mouth sores. That makes a heart-healthy diet an important part of a lupus treatment plan."
Why could foods that fight inflammation help with lupus symptoms?,"Still, good nutrition is an important part of an overall treatment plan for the disease. So it's possible, though not proven, that foods that fight inflammation could help lupus symptoms. On the other hand, foods that fuel inflammation could worsen them."
What are signs of a picky eater?,"They can also be signs your little one is simply full, distracted, or not feeling well. A baby can seem picky for dozens of reasons -- or no reason at all. There's only one way to find out: Try slowing down the next feeding, or picking up the pace."
What are some tips to help tame a picky eater?,"Never force feed. Try different textures. Transform the tempo. Some babies want to eat fast, others slow. Minimize distractions. Turn off the TV, remove toys and books, and help your little one focus on one thing: Eating. Keep meal length reasonable. Although you shouldn't rush mealtime, don't let it go on much longer than 20-30 minutes. Let baby touch his food. Let your baby participate. By about 9 months, many babies are interested in trying to feed themselves. Don't let on that you're frustrated or angry. Understand who's responsible for what. It's your job to feed your baby, but it's your baby's responsibility to decide what and how much to eat."
"Where can someone buy lancets, strips, and meters?",Ask your doctor or diabetes educator for advice on what kind to buy. Take your blood testing items with you when you see your doctor or nurse so that you can learn how to use them the right way. You can buy strips for testing urine ketones at a drugstore.
Do I need to worry about exercise if I am not on diabetes medication?,They'll also show you the best places on your body to give yourself a shot. The needles are small and sharp and do not go deep into your skin. Diabetes medications are safe and easy to take. You need to know if you are lowering your blood sugar.
What if my body makes insulin but it doesn't lower my blood sugar?,"Some are taken once a day, and others are taken more often. Ask your doctor when you should take yours. You may also need them if the diabetes pills no longer lower your blood sugar. Some people test their blood once a day."
Are diabetes pills safe?,"Diabetes medications are safe and easy to take. Be sure to tell your doctor if yours make you feel bad or if you have any other problems. Remember, you'll still have to follow an eating plan and exercise to help lower your blood sugar. You may be able to stop taking diabetes pills if you lose weight. Losing even a little bit can help lower your blood sugar."
What should someone who uses insulin do?,"Eat about the same amount of food each day at about the same time. Don't skip meals, especially if you've already given yourself an insulin shot. Your blood sugar may go too low. Your doctor will tell you what kind of insulin to use, how much, and when to give yourself a shot."
How does exercise affect someone who uses insulin?,"If You Use Insulin Exercise after eating, not before. Test your blood sugar before, during, and after. If You Don't Use Insulin See your doctor before starting an exercise program. Test your blood sugar before and after exercising if you take diabetes pills. You want it no lower than 70 or no higher than 240."
Where should I keep extra insulin?,"When you're being active, carry a snack with you in case your blood sugar drops. Keep extra insulin in your refrigerator in case you break the bottle you're using. Too much heat, cold, or bright light can damage insulin."
How and why would I need an insulin shot for diabetes?,"Some people give themselves one a day. Some people give themselves two or more a day. Never skip a shot, even if you are sick. Your doctor will tell you what kind of insulin to use, how much, and when to give yourself a shot. Your doctor or the diabetes educator will show you how to draw up insulin in the needle. Ask someone to help you with your shots if your hands are shaky or you can't see well. If You Don't Use Insulin or Take Diabetes Pills Everyone with diabetes needs to follow their doctor's advice about eating and getting enough exercise."
How is a thrombolysis done?,"Bypass grafts Dialysis catheters If a blood clot is determined to be life threatening, thrombolysis may be an option if initiated as soon as possible -- ideally within one to two hours -- after the onset of symptoms of a heart attack, stroke, or pulmonary embolism (once a diagnosis has been made). But treatment for a severe blockage may be necessary for several days. During this procedure, a long catheter tipped with a tiny suction cup, rotating device, high-speed fluid jet, or ultrasound device is used to physically break up the clot. Thrombolysis may not be recommended for patients who use blood-thinning medication, herbs, or dietary supplements, or for people with certain conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Although thrombolysis is usually successful, the treatment is not able to dissolve the blood clot in up to 25% of patients."
What is the prognosis after thrombolysis?,"Thrombolysis, also known as thrombolytic therapy, is a treatment to dissolve dangerous clots in blood vessels, improve blood flow, and prevent damage to tissues and organs. Another 12% of patients subsequently redevelop the clot or blockage in the blood vessel. In addition, thrombolysis alone -- even when successful -- cannot treat tissue that has already been damaged by compromised blood circulation. So, further treatment may be needed to address the underlying causes of the blood clot and repair damaged tissues and organs."
Can you get vitamin E naturally from foods?,"People on very low-fat diets may also have low levels of vitamin E. The recommended dietary allowance ( RDA) includes the vitamin E you get from both the food you eat and any supplements you take. Good sources of vitamin E include: Vegetable oils Green leafy vegetables, like spinach Fortified cereals and other foods Eggs Nuts The risks and benefits of taking vitamin E are still unclear."
What are the risks of taking vitamin E?,"However, the risks and benefits of taking vitamin E supplements are still unclear. Long-term use (over 10 years) of vitamin E has been linked to an increase in stroke. In addition, an analysis of clinical trials found patients who took either synthetic vitamin E or natural vitamin E in doses of 400 IU per day -- or higher -- had an increased risk of dying from all causes, which seems to increase even more at higher doses. Cardiovascular studies also suggest that patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who take natural vitamin E at 400 IU per day have an increased risk of heart failure and heart failure-related hospitalization. Vitamin E supplements might be harmful when taken in early pregnancy. One study found that women who took vitamin E supplementation during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy had a 1.7 to nine-fold increase in congenital heart defects. The exact amount of vitamin E supplements used by pregnant women in this study is unknown. A large population study showed that men using a multivitamin more than seven times per week in conjunction with a separate vitamin E supplement actually had a significantly increased risk of developing prostate cancer."
What is vitamin E used for?,"These are substances that protect cells from damage. However, the risks and benefits of taking vitamin E supplements are still unclear. They're more likely in people who have diseases, such as digestive problems and cystic fibrosis. Topical vitamin E can irritate the skin."
Why do people take vitamin E?,"But studies of vitamin E for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and many other conditions have been disappointing. So far, the only established benefits of vitamin E supplements are in people who have an actual deficiency. Vitamin E deficiencies are rare. They're more likely in people who have diseases, such as digestive problems and cystic fibrosis. People on very low-fat diets may also have low levels of vitamin E. The recommended dietary allowance ( RDA) includes the vitamin E you get from both the food you eat and any supplements you take. Cardiovascular studies also suggest that patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who take natural vitamin E at 400 IU per day have an increased risk of heart failure and heart failure-related hospitalization."
How safe is prednisone and other oral steroids in treating asthma?,"Prednisone is an oral steroid medication. Besides prednisone, other systemic steroids used in the treatment of asthma include: Medrol, Methylpred, Solu- Medrol (methylprednisolone) Deltasone (prednisone) Prelone, Pediapred, Orapred, (prednisolone) Decadron (dexamethasone) While a two-week course or ""short burst"" of oral steroids like prednisone is relatively safe, it's important to avoid steroids on a long-term basis as there are potential serious side effects. Taking supplemental calcium may help to prevent osteoporosis or thinning of the bones, which is one of the side effects of long-term steroid use. Steroids have many potential side effects, especially when given orally and for a long period of time. After introduction of inhaled steroids, the need for oral steroids such as prednisone may decrease."
What are other systemic steroids besides prednisone is used to treat asthma?,"Prednisone is an oral steroid medication. Besides prednisone, other systemic steroids used in the treatment of asthma include: Medrol, Methylpred, Solu- Medrol (methylprednisolone) Deltasone (prednisone) Prelone, Pediapred, Orapred, (prednisolone) Decadron (dexamethasone) While a two-week course or ""short burst"" of oral steroids like prednisone is relatively safe, it's important to avoid steroids on a long-term basis as there are potential serious side effects."
How long should I take prednisone in treating asthma?,Prednisone is an oral steroid medication. Sometimes systemic steroids like prednisone are taken in high doses for a few days. This is called a steroid burst. They may also be given in a low dose daily or every other day for long-term asthma control.
What anti-inflammatory drug can be used for asthma as well as other lung diseases?,"Prednisone and other steroids (inhaled, oral, or by injection) help calm airway inflammation in asthma. If you've ever had a serious asthma attack, you may have had high doses of steroids in the hospital administered intravenously. After introduction of inhaled steroids, the need for oral steroids such as prednisone may decrease."
What is constipation?,"As fecal material sits in the colon, the harder the stool becomes and the more difficult it is to pass. A normal stool should not be either unusually hard or soft, and you shouldn't have to strain unreasonably to pass it. Bowel habits tend to vary with age and circumstances."
How do doctors diagnose childhood depression?,But tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) and interviews by a mental health professional that include taking a careful history can help to make an accurate diagnosis. There can be spontaneous recovery from childhood depression.
Are the symptoms of childhood depression always the same?,"The symptoms of childhood depression may vary. In fact, kids have different symptoms of childhood depression at different times and in different settings. Some children may continue to function reasonably well in structured environments. But most kids with childhood depression will suffer a very noticeable change in social activities, a loss of interest in school, poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Children may also begin using drugs or alcohol. Or they may start smoking cigarettes, especially if they are over age 12."
How is childhood depression different from regular sadness?,"Childhood depression is different from the everyday ""blues"" that most kids get as they develop. The fact that a child feels sad, lonely, or irritable does not mean he or she has childhood depression. Childhood depression is persistent sadness. When it occurs, the child feels alone, hopeless, helpless, and worthless. When this type of sadness is unending, it disrupts every part of the child's life. It interferes with the child's daily activities, schoolwork, and peer relationships. Treatment options for kids with childhood depression are similar to those for adults."

So if you're thirsty, have some water."
What drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"The formula for treating RA often is a mix. Doctors draw from three main groups of FDA-approved medicines: 1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) ease pain and inflammation. Some, like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium, are over-the-counter drugs. You need a prescription for others, including a kind called COX-2 inhibitors, which can be easier on your stomach. Corticosteroids, including prednisone, act quickly to control inflammation. These strong drugs have strong side effects, so doctors limit the dose and how long you take them. They block the effects of chemicals released when your immune system mistakenly attacks your joints. Methotrexate is usually the first DMARD prescribed, often as soon as someone is diagnosed. Doctors now know that a delay might make your RA worse. Medical and dental researchers are revisiting the link between joint disease and gum disease."
What new kinds of biologics are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Thanks to genetics research, many new drugs to treat RA have come online in the past 15 years. Before then, DMARDs were man-made. Most of the newest drugs are biologics, meaning they're made from human genes. These potent copycats may stop an overactive immune system. Because these drugs target specific steps in the inflammation process, they don't wipe out your entire immune system, as some other RA treatments do. For many people, a biologic drug can slow, modify, or stop the disease -- even when other treatments haven't helped much. The first of a new kind of DMARD, Jakinibs or JAK inhibitors, was approved in 2012. Sometimes called an âoral biologic,â this medicine is available as a pill rather than as a shot or an infusion, as with the other biologics. Jakinibs work from inside the cells to block the enzymes that alert the immune system to an invader. Several such drugs are in the works."
What are current areas of study for rheumatoid arthritis?,"There's still much to learn about why and how RA happens. Building on recent discoveries, areas under study include: Researchers are looking at genes to see why some people get RA and some don't, and why some cases are worse than others. This data can lead to biologics -- like JAK inhibitors -- that fight the causes of RA at a cellular level. Another area of RA research focuses on proteins made to target molecules that affect your immune system. They're called monoclonal antibodies, and several are approved by the FDA for use in RA. Statins, commonly used to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease, are being studied to see if they can lessen the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Medical and dental researchers are revisiting the link between joint disease and gum disease."
What are the symptoms of an enlarged pancreas?,"The pancreas is a gland that sits behind your stomach in the upper abdomen and helps with digestion.

That makes it quite beneficial for many people with fibromyalgia."
What happens during a stress echocardiogram?,"A cardiac sonographer will place three electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on your chest. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiography monitor ( EKG) that charts your heart's electrical activity. The electrodes are attached to an EKG that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test. If you are getting a stress test with medication, an IV will be put into a vein in your arm so medication (such as dobutamine) can be delivered directly into your bloodstream. The technician will perform a resting EKG, measure your resting heart rate, and take your blood pressure. The doctor or nurse will put the medication into the IV while the technician continues to get echo images. The medication will cause your heart to react as if you were exercising. At regular intervals, the lab personnel will ask how you are feeling. The IV will be removed from your arm once all of the medication has entered your bloodstream. The medication may cause a warm, flushing feeling and in some cases, a mild headache. If you begin to notice these or other symptoms of concern like chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or irregular heartbeats, tell the lab personnel immediately. If the test is done on a treadmill or arm ergometer, you will perform exercise until you are fatigued, you reach your target heart rate, or you have symptoms. During activity, your blood pressure will be regularly checked. An echo will be done before and after exertion, and the images will be compared."
What happens during an echocardiogram?,"Echo is often combined with tests called Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to check the blood flow through the heart's valves.

You'll be asked to remove your clothing from the waist up. The wand will have a small amount of gel on the end. You may or may not hear the sounds during the test. You may feel coolness from the gel on the transducer and a slight pressure of the transducer on your chest. After the test, you can get dressed and go back to your daily activities. Before your stress echo, a technician will gently rub several small areas on your chest and place electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an EKG that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test. The appointment will take about 60 minutes. Before a transesophageal echo, you will be asked to remove any dentures and lie down on your left side on the exam table."

How is psoriasis treated if you have a weak immune system?,"Radiation and chemotherapy weaken your immune system. When you take a drug that slows down your immune system, like cyclosporine, methotrexate, or biologic drugs, your body can't fight off infection like it normally would."
How is psoriasis treated if you have kidney disease?,"Psoriasis can make you more likely to get type 2 diabetes, especially if your skin disease is serious. If you have severe kidney problems, you shouldn't take acitretin, cyclosporine, or methotrexate, and you should take a smaller-than-normal dose of apremilast ( Otezla)."
How is psoriasis treated if you have an infection?,"If your natural infection-fighting system is weak because of certain diseases (such as HIV) or medications (such as chemotherapy), it can be dangerous to take drugs that affect your immune system. If you have an active serious infection, you shouldn't take these. You should also be tested to see if you've been exposed to tuberculosis or are carrying hepatitis B. Many antibiotics that treat infections shouldn't be taken with systemic drugs. Some change how well your body absorbs the psoriasis drug. Others keep your kidneys from flushing the medicine from your system. That can let it build up to dangerous levels."
What are the symptoms of a brain tumor in adults?,"The second most common type of adult brain tumors are meningeal tumors. Because different areas of the brain control different functions of the body, where the tumor lies affects the way symptoms are manifested. Some tumors have no symptoms until they are quite large and then cause a serious, rapid decline in health. Other tumors may have symptoms that develop slowly. A common initial symptom of a brain tumor is headaches. Often, they don't respond to the usual headache remedies. Keep in mind that most headaches are unrelated to brain tumors."
How do primary brain tumors happen?,"A primary brain tumor is one that originates in the brain, and most primary brain tumors are benign. The most common types of adult brain tumors are gliomas as in astrocytic tumors. These tumors form from astrocytes and other types of glial cells, which are cells that help keep nerves healthy."
What is a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN)?,"Generally, a pulmonary nodule must grow to at least 1 cm in diameter before it can be seen on a chest X-ray. An SPN is surrounded by normal lung tissue and is not associated with any other abnormality in the lung or nearby lymph nodes (small, bean-shaped structures found throughout the body). However, the accuracy decreases (60%-80%) in nodules that are smaller than 2 cm in diameter."
How is hormone therapy used to treat advanced prostate cancer?,The goal is to cut the supply of hormones that fuel your prostate cancer. Hormone therapy shuts down this process. It will: Dramatically lower your testosterone levels Prevent prostate cancer cells from using low levels of androgens Most doctors think it makes sense to start this type of treatment as soon as prostate cancer becomes advanced.
What are newer types of hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer?,Newer types of hormone therapy include: Abiraterone acetate ( Zytiga). It's approved for men with advanced prostate cancer who have tried other hormone therapies. Enzalutamide ( Xtandi): It's a pill that blocks cells from receiving androgens. It's approved for men with advanced prostate cancer who have tried other hormone therapies.
How do you take hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer?,"There are several hormone therapy drugs. Doctors implant others under your skin. Your doctor will set your drug schedule based on your particular needs and how your cancer responds. If you become resistant to hormone therapy or have problems with side effects, your doctor may try ""intermittent therapy."" This means you'll take the drugs for a while, then stop, then start again. This can improve your quality of life and make the hormone therapy work better."
How is immunotherapy used to treat advanced prostate cancer?,"It uses your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- to attack the cancer cells. Sipuleucel- T ( Provenge) is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. To make it, the doctor removes white blood cells from your blood. These go to a lab, where experts genetically engineer them to fight your prostate cancer. You then get these cancer-killing cells by IV injection in three separate treatments. If other treatments stop working and your cancer grows, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy."
Are there in-home tests I can take to figure out if I have HIV?,"A rapid antibody/antigen test can give you results in 20 minutes. One option is to prick your finger to get a small blood sample that you send to a lab. You call to get your result within a few business days, and it's anonymous (you don't have to give your name). Maybe 1 in 12 people who are infected get a false negative from this test. You should get a lab test of your blood if it's positive. And in fact, the CDC recommends that all persons in the United States between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once."
How do  antibody/antigen combination tests help diagnose HIV?,"The CDC recommends these blood tests. They can detect HIV earlier than antibody screening tests. They check for HIV antigen, a protein called p24 that's part of the virus that shows up 2-4 weeks after infection. They also check for HIV antibodies. You get a result in 20 minutes."
How do I know if I have HIV?,"Most can't detect HIV right away, because it takes time for your body to make antibodies or for enough virus to grow inside you. It may be up to 6 months before you'll see a positive result, which means an early test could be negative even though you're infected. If you do have the virus, finding out quickly means you can start treatment to help you live a long and full life. You can also take precautions so that you don't pass HIV to other people. Some immunoassay tests check urine or fluids from your mouth (not saliva), but there aren't as many antibodies in these, so you may not get a positive result even if you're infected. If you had a lab test, more detailed tests on your blood sample can help confirm the diagnosis: Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay Antibody differentiation, between HIV-1 and HIV-2 If you got an HIV test within the first 3 months after you could have been infected and it was negative, get another test at 6 months to be sure."
How does an RNA test help diagnose HIV?,"Usually, a technician will take a small blood sample and send it to a lab for testing. You call to get your result within a few business days, and it's anonymous (you don't have to give your name). If you had a lab test, more detailed tests on your blood sample can help confirm the diagnosis: Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay Antibody differentiation, between HIV-1 and HIV-2 If you got an HIV test within the first 3 months after you could have been infected and it was negative, get another test at 6 months to be sure."
What are the benefits of kicking the tobacco habit?,"Regardless of how long you have used tobacco products, quitting now can greatly reduce serious risks to your health. Eleven years after quitting, former smokers' likelihood of having periodontal (gum) disease was not significantly different from people who never smoked. They state that: About 90% of people with cancer of the mouth, lips, tongue, and throat use tobacco, and the risk of developing these cancers increases with the amount smoked or chewed and the duration of the habit. Smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop these cancers. About 37% of patients who persist in smoking after apparent cure of their cancer will develop second cancers of the mouth, lips, tongue, and throat, compared with only 6% of those who stop smoking."
Are smokeless tobacco products less likely to harm your dental health than cigarettes?,"Like cigars and cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products (for example, snuff and chewing tobacco) contain at least 28 chemicals that have been shown to increase the risk of oral cancer and cancer of the throat and esophagus. In fact, chewing tobacco contains higher levels of nicotine than cigarettes, making it harder to quit than cigarettes. Exposed roots are also more sensitive to hot and cold or other irritants, making eating and drinking uncomfortable. In addition, sugars, which are often added to enhance the flavor of smokeless tobacco, can increase your risk for tooth decay."
How do you know if you have heart failure or a heart attack?,"A lot of things go on inside you that set up your troubles, but here's the big picture. It happens when your heart doesn't pump enough blood through your body to meet its needs. Other things that play a role in heart failure are: Genetics Infections Alcohol or drug abuse Chemotherapy Long-term diseases like diabetes, HIV, hypertension, and hypothyroidism Abnormal heart rhythms All these can cause the heart to work in overdrive, weakening it over time."
What does heart failure feel like?,"When they do appear, they can include things like: Shortness of breath Persistent cough or wheeze Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, or belly Weight gain Fatigue Lack of appetite or nausea Faster heart rate Any one of these on their own may not signal heart failure, but talk to your doctor if you have more than one symptom. Less often, a heart attack is caused by a severe spasm in your coronary artery, without any signs of atherosclerosis."
What is osteopenia?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Think of it as a midpoint between having healthy bones and having osteoporosis. Osteopenia is when your bones are weaker than normal but not so far gone that they break easily, which is the hallmark of osteoporosis. Osteopenia, if it happens at all, usually occurs after age 50. Osteopenia -- or seeing it turn into osteoporosis for that matter -- is not inevitable. This condition happens when your body gets rid of more bone than it is creating. Problems in your diet, lack of exercise, and unhealthy habits can contribute to this condition."
What can you do to slow osteopenia?,"But even if you already have osteopenia, it's not too late for you to stop it from turning into osteoporosis with these strategies: Get enough calcium and vitamin D: This may be the most important thing you can do for your bones at any stage of life. Some foods, including orange juice, cereal, and bread, have added calcium and vitamin D. It's also a good idea to spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sun twice a week because this helps your body convert sunlight to vitamin D. If your doctor doesn't think you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D, he or she may suggest that you take a supplement. Weight lifting: You can do regular, weight-bearing exercises to prevent or slow osteopenia. Lifestyle changes: If you smoke, try to quit. Cut down on carbonated drinks and alcohol."
Can you prevent osteopenia?,"Problems in your diet, lack of exercise, and unhealthy habits can contribute to this condition. Watch out for: A lack of calcium or vitamin D Not enough exercise, especially strength training Smoking Too much alcohol Carbonated beverages Osteopenia usually doesn't have any symptoms. Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that's right for you."
Who gets osteopenia?,"Osteopenia, if it happens at all, usually occurs after age 50. The exact age depends how strong your bones are when you're young. You're also more likely to get it if you're a woman. Calcium is the key to keeping bones healthy. Hormone changes that happen at menopause increase the chance for osteopenia for women, and men with lower testosterone levels have higher odds of getting it. People with this condition can damage their small intestine by eating foods with gluten in them."
What should you do if you're claustrophobic and is about to take the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test?,"It's a type of scan that uses a magnetic field, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. You may still be able to get the test. But keep these concerns in mind: Claustrophobia: Tell your doctor if you have fear of tight spaces. You may need to take medicine before the test to calm your anxiety. The MRI technologist does not provide this medicine, so you'll need to mention it to your doctor beforehand."
What should you do if you have allergic reaction and is about to take the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test?,"It's a type of scan that uses a magnetic field, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. It's called a contrast agent, and it helps make the images of your knee even clearer. Allergic reaction: If you get the contrast dye before the exam, there is a small risk you could have an allergic reaction. Your medical team can treat it quickly with medications, so be sure to tell the doctor or MRI technologist if you have any allergic symptoms, such as itching, a skin rash, trouble breathing, or a change in your heartbeat."
How is arachnoiditis diagnosed?,"Infection from bacteria or viruses: Infections such as viral and fungal meningitis or tuberculosis can affect the spine. A test called an electromyogram ( EMG) can assess the severity of the ongoing damage to affected nerve roots by using electrical impulses to check nerve function. Note: Myelograms with the radiographic contrast currently in use, combined with CAT scanning, are not considered to be responsible for causing arachnoiditis or causing it to worsen."
What is arachnoiditis?,"It is characterized by severe stinging, burning pain, and neurological problems. Inflammation of the arachnoid can lead to the formation of scar tissue and can cause the spinal nerves to stick together and malfunction."
What is porphyria?,"If your doctor tells you that you have porphyria, it means you have one of a group of disorders that can cause nerve or skin problems. There's no cure, but you can get treatments that will help you manage your symptoms. If you have porphyria that affects your skin, you'll hear your doctor call it a ""cutaneous porphyria."" When the condition causes a problem with your nervous system, it's called ""acute porphyria."" One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" It also offers support for caregivers."
What causes porphyria cutanea tarda?,"Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. These triggers can be things like: Drinking alcohol Estrogen use by women Hepatitis C HIV Smoking Episodes of acute porphyria, which rarely happen before puberty, can be set off by taking some kinds of drugs, including: Barbiturates Sulfa antibiotics Birth control pills Seizure medicines Other things that might trigger acute porphyria are: Fasting Smoking Drinking alcohol Infections Menstrual hormones Stress Being in the sun The symptoms of acute porphyria can develop quickly and last for days or weeks."
What causes porphyria?,"No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It's made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme. The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited."
How common is male sexual dysfunction?,"Problems with sexual functioning are common, affecting more than half of all couples at some time. If your sexual problem only occurs under a particular set of circumstances, or only with certain sexual partners, then your condition is considered to be ""situational"" rather than ""generalized"" (occurring regardless of the circumstances or partner)."
How common is diabetes and how often does diabetes cause complications?,"Having the disease makes you more likely to get some serious complications. The combination of the two can even make some health problems worse. Doctors still have a lot to learn about the connection, but the best way to reduce your odds of getting it is to keep your diabetes under control."
Can diabetes put me at risk for having the flu?,"That's because both diabetes and age weaken your immune system, making you less able to fight infections. If you come down with the flu, call the doctor."
What is macular degeneration?,"More than 2 million adult Americans suffer from glaucoma, making it one of the leading causes of irreversible vision loss. Because the symptoms usually do not appear in people under 55 years of age, the disorder is more accurately referred to as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Since the macula is the central part of the retina, AMD affects central vision, the detailed vision you need for driving, reading, and close work like sewing. If you were looking at a photograph, you would not be able to see the middle of the picture but could still see the edges (preserved peripheral vision). The disorder occurs in two forms, dry and wet. The less common wet form of AMD requires immediate medical attention. Any delay in treatment may result in loss of your central vision."
What are the different types of glaucoma?,"Nearsightedness and farsightedness have to do with the way the eye brings images into focus on the back of the eyeball, where 10 layers of delicate nerve tissue make up the retina. More than 2 million adult Americans suffer from glaucoma, making it one of the leading causes of irreversible vision loss. Types of glaucoma include the following: Chronic open-angle glaucoma ( COAG), which accounts for 90% of all cases in the U. S., usually appears in middle age and seems to have a genetic component. Closed-angle glaucoma can be either chronic and acute. Chronic is a slow progression of the disease, but it can turn into a sudden emergency. With acute, there is sudden pain and blurred vision, and you need immediate medical attention. Secondary glaucoma is associated with other eye diseases or medical conditions, trauma to the eye, or the use of steroid drugs. Regular eye checkups usually include measuring eye pressure and other tests in order to identify glaucoma. Unfortunately, half of all Americans with high eye pressure are unaware of the problem."
What are the risk factors for retinal detachment?,"If the retina is not reattached to the eye wall promptly, retinal cells starve and permanent blindness can result. Risk factors for retinal detachment include the following: Moderate or extreme nearsightedness Previous eye surgery or injury Previous retinal detachment Inherited thinness of retinal tissue Color blindness is most commonly a disorder of the retina's light-sensitive photoreceptor cells, which respond to different colored light rays. Although infectious conjunctivitis can be highly contagious, it is rarely serious and will not usually harm vision permanently if detected and treated promptly."
What is nearsightedness and farsightedness like?,"The further away images focus from the retina, the blurrier they appear. Damage to the delicate nerve layers of the retina are caused by elevated pressure inside the eye."
What are the symptoms of an acute closed-angle glaucoma?,"Closed-angle glaucoma can be either chronic and acute. If you have sudden, severe pain in your eyes, blurred vision, or rainbow halos -- along with headache, nausea, or vomiting."
What other eye conditions can lead to vision problems?,"Retinal detachment, macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma are disorders of the functional eye and its processing units. There are other eye conditions that respond in varying degrees to medical and surgical treatment. The most common of these eye problems include: Cataracts Conjunctivitis, or pink eye Glaucoma Crossed or out-turned eyes (strabismus) Lazy eye (amblyopia) Macular degeneration The lens of the human eye focuses light so that you can see objects clearly at various distances. Not every case of strabismus develops amblyopia, and not all cases of amblyopia are due to strabismus."
What are vision problems?,"The most common forms of vision impairment are errors of refraction -- the way light rays are focused inside the eye so images can be transmitted to the brain. Nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism are examples of refractive disorders and often occur when the eyes are otherwise healthy. Refractive errors are correctable usually with glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery, such as LASIK. Other vision problems may be related to eye disease. Retinal detachment, macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma are disorders of the functional eye and its processing units. These problems can lead to blurry or defective vision. The goals of treatment depend on the eye disease and may include restoring vision, halting vision loss, and preserving remaining eyesight. Any problems that are identified need to be addressed in order to preserve good eyesight in both eyes."
What causes amblyopia (lazy eye)?,"Only infants and children develop amblyopia; and the vision loss can be reversed by various treatment strategies which force the child to use the ""lazy"" eye if the contributing eye problem is corrected early enough during childhood -- typically before the age of 7. As long as the underlying eye problem remains untreated, the vision in the weaker eye does not develop fully. Lazy eye can also result from other eye problems, such as: Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid). A significant refractive error in one eye."
How do I know if I have acute closed-angle glaucoma?,"Closed-angle glaucoma can be either chronic and acute. If you have sudden, severe pain in your eyes, blurred vision, or rainbow halos -- along with headache, nausea, or vomiting."
What is chronic open-angle glaucoma?,"Nearsightedness and farsightedness have to do with the way the eye brings images into focus on the back of the eyeball, where 10 layers of delicate nerve tissue make up the retina. Types of glaucoma include the following: Chronic open-angle glaucoma ( COAG), which accounts for 90% of all cases in the U. S., usually appears in middle age and seems to have a genetic component. Most COAG patients have no symptoms whatsoever and can experience profound loss of visual function before it is identified. Regular eye checkups usually include measuring eye pressure and other tests in order to identify glaucoma. Unfortunately, half of all Americans with high eye pressure are unaware of the problem."
Who can get macular degeneration?,"More than 2 million adult Americans suffer from glaucoma, making it one of the leading causes of irreversible vision loss. Because the symptoms usually do not appear in people under 55 years of age, the disorder is more accurately referred to as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD)."
What could happen if the retina is detached?,"If the retina is not reattached to the eye wall promptly, retinal cells starve and permanent blindness can result. Risk factors for retinal detachment include the following: Moderate or extreme nearsightedness Previous eye surgery or injury Previous retinal detachment Inherited thinness of retinal tissue Color blindness is most commonly a disorder of the retina's light-sensitive photoreceptor cells, which respond to different colored light rays. Although infectious conjunctivitis can be highly contagious, it is rarely serious and will not usually harm vision permanently if detected and treated promptly."
What is opthalmia neonatorum?,"It must be treated immediately by a doctor to prevent permanent eye damage or blindness. These infants may have infections elsewhere, such as in the lungs. Congenital glaucoma is a rare problem in babies and requires surgery to preserve eyesight."
What happens if amblyopia is not treated?,"Only infants and children develop amblyopia; and the vision loss can be reversed by various treatment strategies which force the child to use the ""lazy"" eye if the contributing eye problem is corrected early enough during childhood -- typically before the age of 7. As long as the underlying eye problem remains untreated, the vision in the weaker eye does not develop fully."
What is retinal detachment?,"Nearsightedness and farsightedness have to do with the way the eye brings images into focus on the back of the eyeball, where 10 layers of delicate nerve tissue make up the retina. Unlike wallpaper, however, there is no glue. Small holes can develop in areas where the retina is exceptionally thin or damaged. If that happens, the clear liquid vitreous that fills the eye can seep behind the retina and cause the wallpaper to come off. This is retinal detachment. Color vision works much the same way because visible light is a mixture of different light rays (wavelengths)."
"How can estrogen pills, gel, or patch prevent menstrual migraine attacks?","A menstrual migraine can strike around the start of your period. You can prevent them by taking a steady dose of estrogen throughout your menstrual cycle. If you have migraine with aura, talk to your doctor before you start taking estrogen -- it may raise your odds for a stroke."
How can magnesium help with menstrual migraines?,Some of the medicines that relieve the pain of regular migraine symptoms don't work on menstrual migraine.

How can you prevent migraines during your period?,"Some of the medicines that relieve the pain of regular migraine symptoms don't work on menstrual migraine. You can try a few different approaches to preventing your menstrual migraine. Work with your doctor to figure out which one is best for you. Talk to your doctor about whether these medications might help you stop your headaches before they start. You typically take them twice a day starting 2 to 3 days before your period begins, and then for another 3 to 5 days after it arrives. Your doctor can prescribe these drugs to treat a migraine once it's started, but they also prevent menstrual migraine headaches. Some research has linked the onset of a migraine to low levels of this mineral."
What medications can you use to prevent menstrual migraines?,Talk to your doctor about whether these medications might help you stop your headaches before they start. Triptans.
What drugs can prevent menstrual migraine headaches?,"Take estrogen during the days when you'd normally skip pills or take inactive ones. If your periods don't come on schedule or you also get migraine headaches at other times in your menstrual cycle, you can take preventive medicine every day. Drugs that prevent migraine headaches include: Some types of antidepressants Some types of antiseizure medicines Blood pressure medicines such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers CGRP inhibitors, these are a new class of preventive medicine Devices which may be used for treatment or prevention include:."
What are indoor cycling classes?,"Many gyms offer indoor cycling classes. Or you can join one of the popular cycling boutiques, like Flywheel, which combines indoor cycling with a weighted workout for your arms, or Soul Cycle, which adds mind-body exercise to its bike routine. By the end of the workout, you may feel like you've been through a real adventure. Legs: Yes. All that pedaling will boost your muscle strength and endurance."
How can I get the most out of an indoor cycling class?,"Plan to do 3-5 classes a week for best results. Sometimes you'll get off the saddle and pedal in a standing position. There's a bike for each person in the class. They usually face the same direction, either toward the instructor or a mirror. Your heart rate will soar and stay elevated for 45-60 minutes. There will be brief moments of slower pedaling, but most of the class will be steady work. Cost: Plan to pay for a gym membership or class fees."
What is muscular dystrophy?,This group of rare diseases affects adult men and women. The disease progresses slowly and causes less severe muscle weakness than some other forms of muscular dystrophy.
What is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy?,This form of muscular dystrophy appears in the teens to early adulthood and affects males and females. Oculopharyngeal. Weakness in pelvic and shoulder muscles may occur later. Choking and recurrent pneumonia may occur.
Who is most likely to have muscular dystrophy?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Myotonic Duchenne Becker Limb-girdle Facioscapulohumeral Congenital Oculopharyngeal Distal Emery- Dreifuss Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy affect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before. Those with Duchenne MD usually die in their late teens or early 20s."
How does clostridium perfringens cause food poisoning?,"Foods made in bulk are problematic, too. You may have cramps and diarrhea but no other symptoms. You get sick within 6-24 hours and are usually feeling better in a couple of days. You can get this from undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk, sprouts, or any food or liquid that has had contact with animal feces or sewage."
How do I keep track of how much medication is in my hydrofluoroalkane inhaler for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,"Check the side of the canister for the number of puffs it contains. Then keep track of how many times you use it each day. This way, you can estimate when your HFA is likely to run out. Put that date right on the canister. Some HFAs contain a color-coded side window that indicates when the medication is running out. If so, ask your doctor about HFAs that count the puffs each time you press the inhaler. Or ask about getting two inhalers at a time. When one runs out, get a refill so you always have an inhaler handy. Throw away the HFA when it is empty, even if it continues to spray."
What is a dry powder inhaler for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,"A hydrofluoroalkane inhaler is a handheld device that delivers a specific amount of medication in aerosol form, rather than as a pill or capsule. A DPI delivers medication to the lungs as you inhale through it. It doesn't contain propellants or other ingredients -- just your medication."
What are the risk factors for chronic pancreatitis?,Another top cause is drinking lots of alcohol for a long period of time. People with chronic pancreatitis are usually men between ages 30 and 40.
What causes pancreatitis?,"Diarrhea and weight loss because your pancreas isn't releasing enough enzymes to break down food Upset stomach and vomiting Acute pancreatitis causes include: Autoimmune diseases Drinking lots of alcohol Infections Gallstones Medications Metabolic disorders Surgery Trauma In up to 15% of people with acute pancreatitis, the cause is unknown. Chronic pancreatitis causes include: Cystic fibrosis Family history of pancreas disorders Gallstones High triglycerides Longtime alcohol use Medications In about 20% to 30% of cases, the cause of chronic pancreatitis is unknown. Pain medicine If your case is more severe, your treatment might include: ERCP to take out gallstones if they're blocking your bile or pancreatic ducts Gallbladder surgery if gallstones caused your pancreatitis Pancreas surgery to clean out fluid or dead or diseased tissue Treatment for chronic pancreatitis If you have chronic pancreatitis, you might need more treatments, including: Insulin to treat diabetes Pain medicine Pancreatic enzymes to help your body get enough nutrients from your food Surgery or procedures to relieve pain, help with drainage, or treat blockages Because many cases of pancreatitis are caused by alcohol abuse, prevention often focuses on limiting how much you drink or not drinking at all."
How is chronic pancreatitis treated?,"It releases insulin and glucagon into your bloodstream. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis The symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are similar to those of acute pancreatitis. Treatment for acute pancreatitis You'll probably need to stay in the hospital, where your treatment may include: Antibiotics if your pancreas is infected Intravenous ( IV) fluids, given through a needle Low-fat diet or fasting.

Are biologics effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis?,"The goal is to control inflammation to ease joint pain and other symptoms, and to slow down or stop joint damage. Though it may take some time to find the one that works best for you, most people eventually have some improvement in their RA symptoms. Studies show that these improvements usually last, and that they can help you move better and handle your daily activities."
How is jumper's knee treated?,"Certain ""loading"" exercises may be prescribed. Stretching: Stretch (1) flexors of the hip and knee (hamstrings, gastrocnemius, iliopsoas, rectus femoris, adductors), (2) extensors of the hip and knee (quadriceps, gluteals), (3) the iliotibial band (a large tendon on the outside of the hip and upper leg), and (4) the surrounding tissues and structures of the kneecap.

What is the relationship between Ashkenazi Jews and colorectal cancer?,"These patients are also at increased risk of bowel cancer. This is thought to be due to a variant of the APC gene that is found in 6% of this population. Ashkenazi Jews make up the majority of the Jewish population in the U. S. If you suspect that you are at risk for an inherited form of colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor. There may be a genetic test that can be performed to confirm your suspicions."
What are other forms of inherited colorectal cancer?,"The two most common inherited colorectal cancer syndromes are hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP). Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of more than hundreds or even thousands of benign polyps, or growths in the large intestine and upper respiratory tract. Families in which this gene mutation occurs may or may not have one or more family members with colorectal cancer or polyps. Presence of polyps, or growths that can become cancer. Patients with PJS typically develop dozens to thousands of benign polyps, or growths, in the stomach and intestines, primarily in the small intestine.

In other words, repeat DXA scans cannot distinguish between a real increase in bone density due to treatment or a mere variation in measurement from the machine itself. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and American College of Physicians now recommend against menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen or estrogen and progesterone For all of these reasons, as surprising as it may sound to many people (and even some doctors), rechecking bone density is not at all like checking blood pressure during treatment of high blood pressure. Routine bone density testing during treatment is unlikely to be helpful."

What affects the prevalence of Lyme disease?,"In some cases, symptoms can appear months after the bite. But the deer population has rebounded as reforestation took place over several decades, meaning the tick population has risen and expanded as well. Deer and white-footed mice, which transmit Lyme disease to ticks that bite them, are moving closer to humans as their habitats disappear, says Taege. Another reason: Warmer weather and mild winters may bring more people outside, raising their chances of being bitten, particularly in Lyme-prone areas, Taege says. â We've seen an expansion [of ticks] in areas in which the vectors live, and we've slowly seen more Lyme disease.â That doesn't mean you should be afraid of outdoor activities, as long as you take precautions to avoid tick bites, Aucott says."
How prevalent is Lyme disease?,"The CDC estimates there are more than 300,000 cases of Lyme infection in the U. S. each year -- or 10 times as many as what is reported.

In the Southern U. S., which is more prone to hot weather, ticks tend to stay under leaf litter and don't come up higher to feed much, Aucott says -- âticks don't like to dry out.â This means Southern ticks don't transmit Lyme as frequently because they don't tend to feed on humans."
What symptoms does Lyme disease cause?,"â Ten percent of people don't get better after antibiotics,â Aucott says. Scientists point to a variety of causes for the spread of Lyme infection."
What are the early signs and symptoms of Lyme disease?,"Early signs and symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes -- all common in the flu. In up to 80% of Lyme infections, a rash is one of the first symptoms, Aucott says. Heart palpitation or an irregular heartbeat Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet About 20% to 30% of Lyme rashes have a âbull's-eyeâ appearance -- concentric circles around a center point -- but most are round and uniformly red and at least 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) across, Aucott says. â Most are just red,â he says. â They do not have the classic ring within a ring like the Target logo.â The rash expands gradually over a period of days and can grow to about 12 inches across, the CDC says. It may feel warm to the touch, but it rarely itches or is painful, and it can appear on any part of the body."
What should I do if a tick with Lyme disease bites my dog?,"The more ticks in your region, the likelier it is that your furry pal will bring them home. â On the flip side, low rates of exposure in dogs is a good indicator that Lyme is not a problem in the area.â And they can get sick. About 10% of dogs with Lyme disease will become ill.

What is a dental cap?,"If a large piece of tooth breaks off or the tooth has a lot of decay, the dentist may grind or file away part of the remaining tooth and cover it with a crown, or tooth-shaped cap, made to protect the tooth and improve its appearance. Permanent crowns can be made from metal, porcelain fused to metal, all resin, or all ceramic. If the entire top of the tooth is broken off but the root is still intact, the dentist or an endodontist (a dentist who specializes in root canals) may perform root canal therapy and place a pin or a post in the canal, and then build up enough of a structure onto which a crown can be made. Later, the dentist can cement the crown over the pin or post-retained restoration. If a front tooth is broken or chipped, a dental veneer can make it look whole and healthy again."

How is diagnosis of a chordoma confirmed?,"Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread."
How common is chordoma?,About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull.

If rosacea has made them red and irritated, use a watered-down baby shampoo or eyelid cleaner to gently clean your eyelids every day. Also put a warm compress on your eyes a few times a day."
How do conjugate monoclonal antibodies work?,"They're called ""monoclonal"" antibodies. Different ones work in different ways: Naked monoclonal antibodies, the most common type for cancer treatment, don't have anything attached to them. This lowers side effects and helps treatments like chemotherapy and radiation work their best. Some attach to both a cancer cell and an immune system cell, helping promote immune system attacks on the cancer."
When are monoclonal antibodies used for treatment?,"They're called ""monoclonal"" antibodies. Most people get this type of medication through a vein. Your doctor might also pair it with other treatments like chemotherapy or hormone therapy. How often you get it depends on your cancer type. Research is underway to see how monoclonal antibodies work for many cancer types. These inhibitors treat melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancers, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma."
How is immunotherapy used for adoptive T cell transfer?,"T cells are a type of white blood cell your immune system makes to fight disease. After chemotherapy, your doctor puts the re-engineered T cells back in your body. First, doctors will take TILs from your tumor tissue and grow a large number of them in a lab. These proteins help your TILs find and destroy cancer cells. An interferon called IFN-alfa is used to treat cancers, including: Hairy cell leukemia Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML) Follicular non- Hodgkin's lymphoma Cutaneous (skin) T-cell lymphoma Kidney cancer Melanoma Kaposi sarcoma Colony stimulating factors strengthen your immune system by boosting the production of white blood cells in your bone marrow."
What are interferons?,"General immunotherapies fall into a few different classes of drugs: Interleukins are a type of cytokine, a molecule produced by some immune cells to control the growth and activity of other immune cells. An interferon called IFN-alfa is used to treat cancers, including: Hairy cell leukemia Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML) Follicular non- Hodgkin's lymphoma Cutaneous (skin) T-cell lymphoma Kidney cancer Melanoma Kaposi sarcoma Colony stimulating factors strengthen your immune system by boosting the production of white blood cells in your bone marrow."
What are immune checkpoint inhibitors?,"If these cells have gotten inside the cancer cells, it's a sign that your body is trying to fight the cancer on its own. To keep control, your immune system has molecular brakes called checkpoints. Cancer cells sometimes take advantage of them by turning them on or off so they can hide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs designed to release these brakes and let your immune system do its job."
How is immunotherapy used as a cancer vaccine?,"How often you get it depends on your cancer type. But it can be any compound that's put into your body to start an immune reaction. Vaccines treat cancer by spurring your immune system to attack tumor cells. They can be made of dead cancer cells, proteins or pieces or proteins from cancer cells, or immune system cells. Researchers are working on several right now, but only one is fully approved. Sipuleucel- T ( Provenge) is used to treat advanced prostate cancer that doesn't respond to other treatments."
What is the long-term outlook for children who are not treated for ADHD?,"Hyperactivity can show up as feelings of restlessness in teens and adults. A child with hyperactive behavior may get symptoms of other disruptive disorders, like oppositional-defiant disorder. These children are especially at risk to be more likely to drop out of school. If you're concerned, talk to your or your child's doctor about your treatment options. Medications, behavioral therapy, and other tactics can help."

What are the serious risks of taking lithium for bipolar disorder?,"People who take lithium also should consult with their doctor before taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, because those medications can increase lithium levels. There are a few serious risks to consider. The drug has been linked to certain birth defects and should be used with caution in pregnant women, especially during the first three months of pregnancy. The safety of breastfeeding while taking lithium is controversial and should be discussed in advance with your doctor. Also, in some people, long-term lithium treatment can interfere with kidney function or lead to permanent kidney damage -- which is why periodic monitoring of blood tests to measure kidney functioning is important."

What can help to diagnose seizures in children?,"The research into the genetics of seizures is helping experts discover the particular ways different types of seizures occur. Seizures are over so quickly that your doctor probably will never see your child having one. Also, you may want to keep a video camera handy so that you can tape your child during a seizure. This may sound like an insensitive suggestion, but a video can help the doctor enormously in making an accurate diagnosis. The causes aren't known, but parents of children with epilepsy should know that it's a very rare occurrence."
What are the risks of seizures in children?,"Simple partial seizures, in which a child may have a sudden, overwhelming sense of terror, are especially frightening. One of the problems with complex partial seizures, for instance, is that people have no control of their actions. They may wind up doing inappropriate or bizarre things that upset people around them. It's also possible for children to injure themselves during a seizure if they fall to the ground or hit other things around them. But the seizures themselves are usually not harmful. Although the majority of seizures aren't dangerous and don't require immediate medical attention, one kind does."
How does an altimeter help people track their fitness?,"Some devices have an altimeter to count the flights of stairs or hills you climbed.

Some devices even sense your body temperature and sweat to gauge how hard you're exercising. If you have heart problems or take certain blood pressure medicines, ask your doctor if checking your heart rate during exercise is a good way to measure your exercise intensity."
What causes food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)?,"You may notice that a couple of hours after your baby eats, she vomits over and over and then gets diarrhea. If you notice these signs, take your child to the hospital right away: Apparent confusion Cool or clammy skin Extreme thirst Pale or even blue skin Shallow breaths Sluggishness or tiredness Weak pulse The syndrome is caused by cells in your child's immune system that react badly to certain foods. This leads to a severe reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. About 40% to 80% of kids who have the allergy have family members who also have other types of allergies such as hay fever or eczema skin rashes. This will be done in a clinic or hospital."
What triggers food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)?,"But if your child has a rare allergy called food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome ( FPIES), the reaction may not happen until a few hours after he eats. You may notice that a couple of hours after your baby eats, she vomits over and over and then gets diarrhea.

Some children have symptoms that get worse over time, and they may not grow like they should. Severe attacks can lead to dehydration and shock. That can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure or body temperature. If you notice these signs, take your child to the hospital right away: Apparent confusion Cool or clammy skin Extreme thirst Pale or even blue skin Shallow breaths Sluggishness or tiredness Weak pulse The syndrome is caused by cells in your child's immune system that react badly to certain foods. This will be done in a clinic or hospital."
How is food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) diagnosed?,"But if your child has a rare allergy called food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome ( FPIES), the reaction may not happen until a few hours after he eats. You may notice that a couple of hours after your baby eats, she vomits over and over and then gets diarrhea. An APT involves putting a possible trigger food into a metal cap that's put on your child's skin for 48 hours to see if there's a reaction. But these tests can't confirm that your child has FPIES. The only way to tell for sure is to do something called an oral food challenge, or OFC. Your child will eat foods you think may be triggers to see if there's a reaction. This will be done in a clinic or hospital."
What is food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)?,"Unlike other food allergies, this one won't make your child wheeze, break out in hives, or get a rash. Instead, he may vomit or get diarrhea. FPIES typically starts when your child has formula or solid food. Breast milk doesn't usually trigger it, but it is possible. Many kids outgrow the allergy by age 3 or 4. But you may not see symptoms until 2 to 8 hours later. This will be done in a clinic or hospital."
What are skin tumors?,Skin cysts are non-cancerous closed pockets or pouches of tissue that are filled with fluid or other material. Skin tumors become extremely common as people get older.
Does Medicare cover long-term care?,"You can choose it ( Medicare Parts A and B) for hospital care and access to any doctor or hospital in the country that accepts Medicare. In addition to signing up with Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan, you may need to enroll in Medicare Parts B and D -- which cover outpatient medical care and prescription drugs -- or you risk paying a penalty later."
What should you keep in mind when signing up for Medicare?,"If you instead choose a Medicare Advantage plan, it most cases it will include prescription drug coverage so you don't have to sign up for a separate Part D plan. That time starts 3 months before you turn 65, the month of your birthday, and 3 months following your birthday. Some people will automatically be enrolled in Medicae Parts A and B, but others have to sign up. If you are unsure if you are automatically enrolled, it is a good idea to check with the Social Securiy office. If you're not aitomatically enrolled and don't enroll in Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan during your open enrollment period, you will pay a penalty for enrolling at a later date. This penalty will occur every month you have Medicare. The same is true if you delay enrollment in a Part D plan for prescription drugs. So don't wait until you're sick or need costly medicine before you sign up. This penalty doesn't apply if you have coverage through your job. But since some employers may require you to enroll in Medicare, check with your HR department before you turn 65."

You typically wear these tiny instruments in or behind your ear to make sounds louder. TV-listening systems make it possible for you to hear the television or radio without turning the volume way up. For example, cross the street or cover your ears when you walk past a loud road construction site. If you work in a noisy workplace, talk to your employer about ear safety. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH) recommends that employers install barrier walls or mufflers in noisy plants to protect their workers' hearing."
How can you tell that you might have hearing loss?,"But you may become more and more cut off from the world of speech and sounds. You may also: Have trouble following a conversation when more than one person speaks at once Think other people are mumbling or not speaking clearly Often misunderstand what others say and respond inappropriately Get complaints that the TV is too loud Hear ringing, roaring, or hissing sounds in your ears, known as tinnitus It depends on the type and source of your hearing loss."
How can iron help rebuild your bone after a fracture?,"When you have a fracture, your body needs it to build new bone for the repair. Iron helps your body make collagen to rebuild bone.

A bit too much alcohol can also make you unsteady on your feet, which can make you more likely to fall and risk an injury to the same bone. Salt: Too much of this in your diet can make you lose more calcium in your urine. Coffee: Lots of caffeine -- more than four cups of strong coffee a day -- can slow down bone healing a little. It might make you pee more, and that could mean you lose more calcium through your urine."
What kind of diet can help rebuild your bone after a fracture?,"A healthy, well-balanced diet rich in key nutrients can help speed that up.

How does treatment help with hepatitis C if you've had it for a while?,"When you see your doctor and start treatment for a chronic hep C infection, you can prevent these problems, improve them, or keep them from getting worse. New drugs can clear the virus from your body in a few months with fewer side effects than older medicines. If there's no virus in your blood 3 months after treatment, you're considered cured. Getting rid of the infection protects others, too. People who get hep C treatment greatly lower the odds that they will pass the virus to someone else."
How can untreated hepatitis C affect your blood?,"Hepatitis C also can cause problems with blood itself. You may not make enough white blood cells, which fight infections, or platelets, which help your blood clot. The infection can also make you bruise easily or get red or purple spots under your skin. Those are signs of a bleeding disorder called immune thrombocytopenic purpura. If you don't treat hep C, it can lead to fatal conditions like liver failure and liver cancer."
How can untreated hepatitis C lead to nerve problems?,"Both can lead to type 2 diabetes. Another condition, called paresthesia, is a feeling of tingling or numbness in your skin."
How can untreated hepatitis C lead to joint and muscle pain?,"If you don't treat hep C, it can lead to fatal conditions like liver failure and liver cancer. A condition called arthralgia causes joint pain and is common in people with hepatitis C. It's different from arthritis, which causes pain and swelling in joints. But infected people can also get hepatitis C-related arthritis. Fibromyalgia, which causes body aches and muscle pain, is also common in people with hepatitis C. People with hepatitis C are about 40% more likely to get long-term kidney disease than those who are not infected."
How can untreated hepatitis C affect you?,"The virus makes it swell. Without treatment of a chronic infection, about 75% to 85% of people who have it get a long-term infection called chronic hepatitis C.

How is arthroscopy done to treat knee osteoarthritis?,"Your doctor may order additional testing, including: X-rays, which can show bone and cartilage damage as well as the presence of bone spurs magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans MRI scans may be ordered when X-rays do not give a clear reason for joint pain or when the X-rays suggest that other types of joint tissue could be damaged. Surgery. Arthroscopy uses a small telescope (arthroscope) and other small instruments. The surgery is performed through small incisions. The procedure is often used on younger patients ( ages 55 and younger) in order to delay more serious surgery."
How does athletics play a role in knee osteoarthritis?,"However, several factors increase the risk of developing significant arthritis at an earlier age.

They're also called corneal ulcers. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and a rare but serious eye parasite can cause keratitis. It's also easier for you to catch pinkeye, or conjunctivitis, when you wear contacts. These infections come from a bacteria or virus in the thin membrane covering the white part of your eye and the inside of your eyelids. Put them in the case, and bring them when you see your eye doctor. They can infect your eye more easily if you're wearing contacts while you're in the water."

Severe or uncontrolled pain Foot or ankle is misshapen or extremely swollen Cannot walk without pain Severe pain when pressing over the medial or lateral malleolus, the bony bumps on each side of the ankle The doctor will check to see if a fracture or other serious injury has happened to require immediate care. But check with your doctor first if you have any medical problems or take any other medicines."
What causes an ankle sprain?,"An unnatural twisting motion can happen when the foot is planted awkwardly, when the ground is uneven, or when an unusual amount of force is applied to the joint. Note it is turned inward."
Should I use ice on an ankle sprain?,"Put the ankle joint at rest by wearing a brace or splint. Ice will counteract the increased blood flow to the injured area. It will reduce the swelling, redness, and warmth. Applied soon after the injury, ice will prevent much of the inflammation from happening. Compression wraps, such as Ace bandages, do not provide much support to prevent movement of the ankle, and you should not apply them tightly."

When should you seek medical care for phlebitis?,"If you are not better in a week or two or if it gets any worse, get reevaluated to make sure you don't have a more serious condition. Your health care provider will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms."
How is phlebitis diagnosed?,"Call your health care provider if you have signs and symptoms of swelling, pain, and inflamed superficial veins on the arms or legs. D-dimer is a blood test that measures a substance that is released as a blood clot dissolves. If this blood test is negative, and you have no risk factors, then it is unlikely that you have a blood clot. Ultrasound can detect clots or blockage of blood flow, especially in larger, more proximal (upper leg) veins. A small hand-held instrument (probe) is pressed against your skin to help identify blood clots and where the obstruction is. This is a painless, noninvasive test. Occasionally a venogram is needed to identify blood clots in the smaller, more distal veins. This is an invasive procedure that requires injecting X-ray dye or contrast material into a vein on the foot, then an X-ray is taken of the flow of the dye up the leg."
What is phlebitis?,"Thrombophlebitis usually occurs in leg veins, but it may occur in an arm. The thrombus in the vein causes pain and irritation and may block blood flow in the veins. Phlebitis can occur in both the surface (superficial) or deep veins. phlebitis, blood clot in the arm, blood clot in the leg, deep venous thrombophlebitis, thrombophlebitis, superficial vein thrombophlebitis, superficial phlebitis, thrombus, inflammation of a vein, deep vein thrombophlebitis"

How can you treat phlebitis at home?,"An anti-inflammatory drug, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, can help lessen the pain and inflammation of superficial phlebitis. If you increase your walking, you increase blood flow. This helps prevent blood clots from developing. Prescription leg compression stockings (knee or thigh high) improve your blood flow and may help to relieve your pain and swelling. Avoid bed rest for prolonged periods. If you have a history of deep vein thrombophlebitis, or if the phlebitis might possibly spread to the deep veins, you will need to take a blood thinner (anticoagulant)."
How is Cushing’s syndrome in dogs treated?,"If Cushing’s syndrome comes from a tumor on your pet’s adrenal glands, the vet might be able to remove it with surgery, which will cure him of the problem. But if the tumor has spread to other parts of his body or he has other health problems, surgery may not be an option. Usually, a dog can live an active, normal life with medication to treat the condition, though he’ll need it for the rest of his life. Drugs are best for dogs with Cushing’s syndrome caused by the pituitary gland or for those with a tumor on their adrenal gland that can't be removed with surgery. The most common drug is trilostane ( Vetoryl). Your pup will need regular check-ups and blood tests to make sure his treatment is working."
What role does plaque play in peripheral artery disease?,"Arteries move blood away from the heart. Peripheral arteries carry blood to other tissues and organs throughout your body. Both can have deposits of fat, cholesterol, and other substances on their inside walls. These deposits are known as plaque. Over time, plaque can build up, narrowing the vessel and making it hard for blood to flow."
What is Buerger's disease?,"Any condition that affects this system is considered vascular disease. This rare disease most often affects the small and medium sized arteries and veins in your arms and legs. They swell up and may get blocked by clots, cutting off blood supply to your fingers, hands, toes, or feet. These body parts will hurt, even when you're resting. If it's severe, you might need to amputate fingers or toes that have died. People with Buerger's disease may also have Raynaud's phenomenon. Although the cause is unknown, there's a strong association with tobacco use -- including cigars and chewing tobacco -- and secondhand smoke."
What is vascular disease?,"A system of flexible tubes -- some big, some very tiny -- move fluids throughout your body. This whole network of vessels is known as your vascular or circulatory system. "" Any condition that affects this system is considered vascular disease. The diseases range from problems with your arteries, veins, and vessels that carry lymph to disorders that affect how blood flows. A disease can lead to your tissues not getting enough blood, a condition called ischemia, as well as other serious, even life-threatening, problems."
How can a secondary lymphedema happen?,"It relies on valves in the vessels and muscle contractions to keep the lymph moving. When vessels or nodes are missing or don't work right, fluid can build up and cause swelling, most often in your arms or legs. This is called lymphedema. A blockage or interruption of the lymphatic system is called secondary lymphedema. It can happen because of: Cancer and cancer treatments, including radiation Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) Infection Scar tissue formation Serious injury Surgery"
What can damaged vein valves cause?,"Unlike arteries, veins have flaps inside called valves. They're usually caused by: Conditions that slow blood flow or make blood thicker, such as congestive heart failure and certain tumors Damaged valves in a vein Damaged veins from injury or infection Genetic disorders that make your blood more likely to clot Hormones, such as estrogen from pregnancy and birth control pills Long bed rest or not being able to move much Surgery, especially some operations on your hips and legs Damaged vein valves or a DVT can cause long-term blood pooling and swelling in your legs, too. That's called chronic venous insufficiency. If you don't do anything about it, fluid will leak into the tissues in your ankles and feet. It may eventually make your skin break down and wear away."
What are different problems of peripheral artery disease?,"Peripheral arteries carry blood to other tissues and organs throughout your body. For example: Blockage in coronary arteries can cause chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. If it's in the carotid arteries that supply your brain, it can lead to a stroke or mini stroke, which is called a transient ischemic attack or TIA. Blockage in the kidneys can lead to trouble with how they work, uncontrolled high blood pressure, and heart failure. A blockage in a leg can lead to leg pain or cramps when you're active -- a condition called claudication -- skin color change, sores or ulcers, and your legs feeling tired. When you don't have any blood flow to a part of your body, the tissues could die."
What is Raynaud's Phenomenon (Raynaud's Disease or Raynaud's Syndrome)?,"Any condition that affects this system is considered vascular disease. This can temporarily shut down blood supply to the area, making your skin look white or bluish and feel cold or numb. The working conditions of some jobs bring on Raynaud's. Or the symptoms might be related to underlying diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. It happens when you're born without certain lymph vessels or when you have a problem with the tubes themselves."
Who is commonly affected by seasonal depression (seasonal affective disorder)?,"In general, though, seasonal affective disorder starts in fall or winter and ends in spring or early summer. Some people with SAD have mild symptoms and feel out of sorts or irritable. Others have worse symptoms that interfere with relationships and work.

How do you know if there is enough medicine in your inhaler?,"You push the inhaler, it sprays out the medicine, and you breathe it in. Many inhalers contain steroids, like prednisone, to treat inflammation. The best way to tell how many doses remain is to mark the number of doses used on the inhaler and then toss it after you've used this number of puffs. You can find the total number of doses on the box or canister. Mark the date on your calendar when you expect to use all of the available puffs in the new inhaler, and replace it before then. Keep one or two extra quick-relief inhalers at home."
What are hydrofluoroalkane inhalers or HFAs and how do they work?,"They work like a spray can. You push the inhaler, it sprays out the medicine, and you breathe it in. A tube-like gadget called a spacer can help kids or people with trouble breathing use an HFA more easily. You can find the total number of doses on the box or canister."

What causes tennis elbow?,"Any activity that strains the muscles around the elbow over and over again can cause it. There's also a version golfers get called âgolfer's elbow.â In tennis, hitting a backhand puts some stress on your forearm muscles, which repeatedly contract when you hit the ball. If you have poor technique or grip the racquet too tightly, that stress may increase in the tendons that connect the forearm muscles to the elbow. The tendons may get small tears. The more you do it -- and tennis is a game of repeated strokes -- the greater the chance for tennis elbow. But the causes are similar: tendon tears caused by repetitive movement, whether it's a golf swing, lifting weights, or simply shaking hands."
How is tennis elbow treated?,"Tennis elbow is a pain focused on the outside of the arm, where your forearm meets your elbow. Tennis elbow can usually be treated with exercise, physical therapy, and medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin), naproxen ( Aleve), and aspirin. Talk to your doctor if you have ongoing pain and think you may need to take pain relievers for an extended time."
What does it feel like to have tennis elbow?,"It's related to a muscle and tendons in your forearm. Tendons connect your muscles to your bones. When you constantly use your arm in a repetitive motion, the tendons at the elbow end of a certain muscle -- the extensor carpi radialis brevis ( ECRB) muscle --- may develop small tears. The tears lead to inflammation and may put stress on the rest of your arm, making it painful to lift and grip things. Left untreated, it can become chronic (that's medical-speak for âongoingâ). Tennis elbow affects up to 3% of the population, particularly adults between 30 and 50 years of age. Golfer's elbow differs from tennis elbow in that the pain is focused on the inside of the elbow."

What is traditional sling surgery?,"With women, doctors use two types of sling surgery: Mid-urethral sling surgery is the most common. Traditional sling surgery is more involved than mid-urethral surgery. Your surgeon will take a strip of tissue from your stomach or thigh to make the sling, or they might use tissue from a donor. Then they'll make two cuts, one in your vagina and one in your belly. They'll stretch the sling through the cut in your stomach, then stitch it to the inside of your stomach wall. Men also can have sling surgery. The surgeon will make a small cut between the scrotum and anus and put the sling around part of the urethral bulb (the enlarged end of the urethra in men). This will squeeze and lift the urethra, which helps prevent leaks."
What is sling surgery?,"The sling is like a hammock that lifts and supports your urethra and the neck of your bladder (where your bladder connects to your urethra) to help prevent leaks. Lifestyle changes like losing weight and doing Kegel exercises may help if you have a mild case of urinary stress incontinence. But if you've tried those and still have symptoms that affect your quality of life, sling surgery might be an option. In most cases, it lessens or stops urine leaks.

This technique removes the vast majority of the glands where breast cancer may be likely to develop. The nipple and surrounding tissue, called the areola, are removed, because the ducts converge toward the nipple, creating a concentrated area of duct tissue. However, the skin of the breast is spared, preserving the breast skin envelope. When skin-sparing mastectomy is combined with immediate breast reconstruction, the results can be excellent. Many women who choose prophylactic mastectomy, often combined with immediate reconstruction, are very pleased, not only with their choice but also the reconstruction. While surgery is not an approach that should be advocated for all high-risk individuals, it can be very important for some women.

For example, activities such as knitting, reading, or listening to music require little physical energy. If your stress seems out of control, talk to a health care professional. Finally, there may be suggestions that are more specific to your situation that would help in combating your fatigue."
How does nutrition impact fatigue with colorectal cancer?,Take a vitamin supplement if you are not sure you are getting enough nutrients. Help others understand and support you.
"When should I use the portion control method for feeding my dogs, and how should I do it?","For the dog who would never stop eating, use the portion control method. First, ask your vet what your dog’s ideal weight is. If you are using a commercial dog food, feed your dog the amount printed on the bag that fits with its ideal weight. Sometimes, however, the suggested amount is more than your dog needs. Your veterinarian can calculate the exact amount to feed. You can feed your dog one or two times a day. It’s best to do it twice daily at 8-12 hour intervals. And if he is, serve that up instead."

What is the outlook for people with schizophrenia?,"Most people with schizophrenia are not violent. Depending on how severe the condition is and how well they get and stick with treatment, they should be able to live with their families or in community settings rather than in long-term psychiatric hospitals. Ongoing research on the brain and how brain disorders happen will likely lead to more effective medicines with fewer side effects."
Are people with schizophrenia dangerous?,"But hospitalization may be the best option for people: With severe symptoms Who might harm themselves or others Who can't take care of themselves at home Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT): In this procedure, electrodes are attached to the person's scalp. Most people with schizophrenia are not violent. More typically, they prefer to withdraw and be left alone. When people with mental illness do take part in dangerous or violent behaviors, it's generally a result of their psychosis and the fear that they're being threatened in some way by their surroundings. Suicide is the top cause of premature death among people with schizophrenia."

Cluster headaches don't have a long list of triggers, the way migraines do."
How is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) treated?,"There is no single test for CJD. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease. Doctors can prescribe pain medicine for the symptoms. Muscle relaxers or anti-seizure drugs can help with stiffness. People with CJD need full-time care once the disease is in its late stage."
"What are the three types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and what causes them?","Each has a different cause: Sporadic: This is the most common type. But sometimes they can fold the wrong way as they form. Familial: This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Acquired: The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that's infected with CJD."
How is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) diagnosed?,"There is no single test for CJD. Doctors diagnose it from your symptoms. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse. A few tests doctors can use include: Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). This brain scan puts together detailed images. This is another type of scan that measures the electrical activity in the brain. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins."
How can using heat or ice help you manage your ankylosing spondylitis pain?,"When the pain is worse than normal and you're having a flare, your doctor may have you try other drugs. Work with a physical therapist. You can use a cold pack on inflamed areas to help with swelling. And you can use heat to loosen up tight muscles and ease joint stiffness. Take a warm shower before a workout, for example, to help you move better."
How can practicing good posture help you manage your ankylosing spondylitis back pain?,"But it only strains your spine more. There is also a risk that your vertebrae -- small, linked bones that form your backbone -- could fuse in a bent-forward position. Ask your spouse, co-worker, or friend to remind you to keep your back straight. If you work at a computer, make sure your station is set up to promote good posture. You'll probably only take them for short times."
What do you need to know about pain management for ankylosing spondylitis?,"It will usually include medications your doctor recommends. When the pain is worse than normal and you're having a flare, your doctor may have you try other drugs. NSAIDs, which lower inflammation, may be a part of your regular daily treatment plan."
Can opioids help control ankylosing spondylitis pain?,"If NSAIDs aren't a part of your treatment plan, talk with your doctor about them. Opioids can be habit-forming though, so you can't take them for a long time, and it's important for your doctor keep an eye on you while you take them."

While there's no one diet that's recommended for AS, foods with anti-inflammatory properties -- such as those high in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon) -- could help."
What is the research backing the association between ADHD and food dye?,"A study of nearly 300 children by the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency in 2007 showed that the consumption of foods containing dyes could increase hyperactive behavior in children. In the study of 3-, 8- and 9-year-olds, children were given three different types of beverages to drink. One of the drink mixtures contained artificial food colorings, including: Sunset yellow ( E110) Carmoisine ( E122) Tartrazine ( E102) Ponceau 4 R ( E124) It also contained the preservative sodium benzoate. The third drink mixture was a placebo and contained no additives. The researchers found that hyperactive behavior by the 8- and 9-year-olds increased with both the mixtures containing artificial coloring additives. The hyperactive behavior of 3-year-olds increased with the first beverage but not necessarily with the second. They concluded that the results show an adverse effect on behavior after consumption of the food dyes."
What is the relationship between food dye and ADHD?,"To date, no conclusive evidence has been found to show that food coloring causes ADHD. Some studies, though, have suggested an association between the two. Most likely, ADHD is caused by the combination of changes in brain structure, environmental factors, and heredity. The hyperactive behavior of 3-year-olds increased with the first beverage but not necessarily with the second."
Does sugar cause symptoms of ADHD?,"Processed sugars and carbohydrates may have an effect on a child's activity level. A child may become more active due to an adrenaline rush produced by this blood sugar spike. However, there has been no proof to date that sugar actually causes ADHD."
What is known regarding the relationship between food coloring and ADHD in children?,"To date, no conclusive evidence has been found to show that food coloring causes ADHD.

Ophthalmoplegic migraines often last a week and may cause a droopy eyelid, double vision, and other eye changes."
What are the signs of a prodrome or an imminent migraine?,"Signs include: Mood changes, excitability, irritability Depression Fatigue and yawning Muscle tension Signs may occur as early as 1 or 2 days before the headache. Practice recognizing early signs. Your efforts may help you abort a headache. It's very rare, but some people get a type of migraine that causes severe muscle weakness or paralysis on one side of the body."
Do migraines cause vertigo?,"Most common types of migraine are Migraine without aura: one sided pain, pulsating, increased pain with activity, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity Migraine with aura: same pain symptoms but also with fully reversible auras (described above) Often, temporary vision loss or distortion in one eye occurs with retinal migraine, which is rare. Some people who get these migraines also have unsteadiness, dizziness, vertigo and difficulty speaking. Be sure to talk with your doctor about it. Dizziness from migraines may make you feel lightheaded or unsteady. Vertigo makes you feel as if the room is spinning. It's often related to changes in your inner ear."

Good sources of fiber are fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grain bread and cereal. Eat bran cereal or add bran cereal to other foods, such as soup. Drink 1 ½ to 2 quarts of water and other fluids a day. ( Note: Milk can cause constipation in some people.) Liquids that contain caffeine, such as coffee and soft drinks, seem to have a dehydrating effect and may need to be avoided until your bowel habits return to normal. Exercise regularly.

How is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) diagnosed?,"It can slow your reflexes and make your arms and legs feel weak. And the sooner you begin it, the better the chance of a complete recovery. Anyone can get CIDP, but it's most common in older adults, and more in men than women. No. Your doctor may also recommend physical therapy."
What are the treatments for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)?,Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG). Your doctor may also recommend physical therapy. Moderate exercise may give you more energy.
What chronic illnesses are often linked with depression?,"Are you worried about depression complications? The rate of depression for both Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis is 40%. For stroke patients, the rate ranges from 10% to 27%."
What questions might my doctor ask if I tell him my knee hurts?,"Be ready to answer questions such as: When did the pain start? Where does it hurt: the front, center, side, or back of the knee? Did it start suddenly or slowly? How would you describe the pain: dull, sharp, or achy? Is the pain always there, or just now and then? Is there any swelling or redness? Does it feel warm? Do any activities make the pain better or worse? Did your pain start because of a specific injury? Your doctor will also ask about: Problems with any other joints Any knee injuries or surgeries you've had Other health issues that might be causing the pain A hip problem, for example, can cause you to walk awkwardly, which throws off alignment of your knees, causing pain."
What are insulin pumps?,"Everyone with type 1 diabetes and many people with type 2 need to take insulin to manage their blood sugar levels. It delivers insulin through a thin tube that goes under your skin. Many people use their pump continuously, and others switch to shots when they go on vacation, want infusion sites to heal, or just want a break."
How do insulin pumps work?,"The device releases insulin almost the way your body naturally would: a steady flow throughout the day and night, called basal insulin, and an extra dose at mealtime, called a bolus, to handle rising blood sugar from the food you eat. You program the pump for both basal and bolus doses. If you eat more than normal, you can program a larger bolus to cover the carbs in your food. Insulin pumps use short-acting and rapid-acting insulin, but not long-acting, since the pump is programmed to deliver a small amount continuously to keep your blood sugar levels even. It's easier to plan for exercise. You don't want to check your blood sugar at least four times a day. Does the pump come with carb counts of common foods to help you decide how much insulin you need? And remember that whatever treatment you use, you can change your mind."

How should I talk to my infant?,"You play ""peek-a-boo"" with your baby. Narrate your activities. During baths, meals, or play, tell her what you're doing and what she's looking at. Read to your baby and talk about the pictures you see. Celebrate, smile, and act excited when she makes sounds and smiles. At around 2 months, babies start making vowel sounds (""ah-ah"" or ""oh-oh""). Mimic these sounds, and mix in some real words, too. When she makes a sound, you should make the sound as well, and then wait for her to respond. This will teach her how to have a conversation."
What is the best way to speak to my baby?,"It's fun, but it's also crucial to her development. She's also listening to you -- she may smile, move her arms and legs, or coo when you speak to her a certain way. For example, hold a ball and say, "" Do you want a ball?"
How should I talk to my baby?,"For your little one to get the most benefits: Talk with her often. Get some alone time with your infant. Baby talk is most beneficial when it's one-on-one between parent and child, with no other adults or children around. When your baby tries to talk back to you, don't interrupt or look away. She needs to know you care about listening to her. Look your child in the eyes. She'll respond better to speech when she's looking right at you. Limit how much TV she sees and hears. Too much can stunt language growth. Your baby needs to hear how words sound in everyday conversation. Mimic these sounds, and mix in some real words, too."
Does talking to my baby help them?,"You talk to her while you're changing her diaper. You sing to her as you rock her to sleep. And when she happily coos, babbles, and gurgles, you make those sounds right along with her. It's fun, but it's also crucial to her development. Her young brain is soaking up the sounds, tones, and language she'll use to say her first words. You play a big role. Children who have parents who talk to them often tend to form stronger language and conversational skills than kids who don't. Talk, sing, coo, babble, and play peek-a-boo with your child."
What tests do you need during testosterone replacement therapy?,"Your doctor will measure your testosterone levels at the 3- and 6-month marks after treatment begins. After that you'll be tested once a year. At the same time, your doctor will check your red blood cell levels. Within 1 to 2 years of TRT, your doctor will measure your bone density if you had osteoporosis when treatment began. Your doctor will evaluate your prostate cancer risk at the start of treatment and may do more tests at the 3- and 6-month marks, and then annually."
What should I do if medicine triggers my rosacea?,But you still need to be physically active. See if you could take a different drug.
Why do triggers make rosacea worse?,"The important thing is to learn what causes your own rosacea symptoms. When you flush, blood rushes to your face, making it red and warmer. So avoiding activities, products, or emotions that cause flushing can reduce your rosacea symptoms."
What is lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) type of breast cancer?,"Depending on which of the two forms of type 0 breast cancer you have, you may not need treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) is when abnormal cells appear in the breast ducts. LCIS increases the risk of developing a cancer in either breast that can spread. Talk with your doctor about what's right for you."
Do I need treatment for stage 0 breast cancer?,"If you do, it's usually very successful. You may not feel a tumor, and there may not be any changes in your mammogram."
Can my doctor prescribe me anything for my skin allergy?,"Your doctor can help you figure out exactly what the cause of your allergy is. He can prescribe stronger antihistamines or steroids to help you feel better faster. In rare cases, skin allergies can lead to a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. If you -- or someone around you -- is wheezing, has chest tightness, or trouble breathing, get medical care immediately."
What is the difference between folate and folic acid?,"Folate, formerly known as folacin, is the generic term for both naturally occurring food folate and folic acid, the fully oxidized monoglutamate form of the vitamin that is used in dietary supplements and fortified foods. They have the same effects. Folate is the natural version found in foods. Folic acid is the man-made version in supplements and added to foods."
Why do I need to take folic acid supplements?,"Folate is the natural version found in foods. Folic acid supplements are standard for pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant. Folic acid may also lower the risk of preeclampsia and early labor. Folate deficiencies are more common in people who have digestive problems, kidney or liver disease, or who abuse alcohol. Folic acid is also used to reduce the toxicity of the drug methotrexate in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis patients."
How can I avoid dehydration?,"You can also lose necessary fluids more quickly than normal when you have a high fever, diarrhea or are throwing up. As your body loses fluids, it also loses electrolytes. These are minerals in your blood and body fluids that affect how your muscles and nerves work. If your infant or young child is dehydrated, you can try the âbabyâ version of a sports drink, like Pedialyte or Equalyte."
When does dehydration happen?,"Dehydration happens when your body loses or uses more fluids than it takes in. It's especially dangerous in older people and young children. As your body loses fluids, it also loses electrolytes."
How can you replace electrolytes to avoid dehydration?,"You can also lose necessary fluids more quickly than normal when you have a high fever, diarrhea or are throwing up. There are many over-the-counter products for doing this. Most people get these through their regular meals by eating meats, vegetables and fruits. But there are also sports drinks, gels, candies and gummies you can take. There's even a tablet that you can dissolve in water and drink."
How can you prevent dehydration in older adults?,"Most people get these through their regular meals by eating meats, vegetables and fruits. Some points to remember: Don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink. Make sure water is within easy reach day and night. Have between 6 and 8 cups of fluids a day. You typically get much of your fluids from regular meals. They contain large amounts of water, salt, and vitamins and can help prevent dehydration."
How can I prepare for the hysterosalpingogram (HSG)?,"Your doctor will probably do the procedure after your period but before you ovulate, since it's less likely you'll be pregnant during this time. She may also have you take an antibiotic. Next she'll insert a thin tube called a cannula into your cervix and gently fill your uterus with a liquid containing iodine. You may have problems if you have an allergic reaction to the dye in the fluid."
How is an hysterosalpingogram (HSG) done?,"You'll start by lying down on a table under an X-ray imager called a fluoroscope. She'll insert a speculum into your vagina to keep it open, and then clean your cervix. Finally your doctor will remove the speculum, and will take images with the fluoroscope X-ray. The contrasting liquid will show the outline of your uterus and fallopian tubes and how the fluid moves through them."
Is it normal to get more sick if I have diabetes?,"An illness like a cold, the flu, or any condition that makes you throw up or gives you diarrhea can also boost your blood sugar. So can an infection. Test for ketones if you have type 1 diabetes and your sugar level is above 240mg/d L -- or if your doctor tells you to."
Who should have a copy of the asthma action plan for your child?,"That's where an action plan can help. Also give a copy to everyone who cares for your child, including: Teachers or day-care workers School nurses Baby sitters Coaches Camp counselors Other family members Review the plan with your child's doctor at least once every 6 months."
What is the green zone of an asthma action plan and what is involved?,"You'll know he's in the green zone when he: Is breathing easy Isn't coughing or wheezing Can do his regular activities Sleeps through the night without coughing If you can say ""yes"" to those four items, he's doing well. Even when he's doing well, keep up his regular medication. This zone means DANGER. Your action plan won't ""cure"" your child's asthma, but it can make a huge difference in how well he keeps it under control."
What is the yellow zone of the an asthma action plan and what is involved?,"Think of this category as a big yellow ""caution"" sign. You'll know your child belongs here when he: Coughs Looks like he's short of breath Wheezes Has some trouble doing his usual activities Has a tight feeling in his chest Wakes up at night with breathing problems If he has some or all of those, make sure he's taking his regular treatment plus any additional medications his doctor recommends. She might prescribe some that give quick relief when your child has symptoms, called rescue medicines. What should you do if the medications don't help? Your action plan won't ""cure"" your child's asthma, but it can make a huge difference in how well he keeps it under control."
What is an asthma action plan for my child?,"When your child has an asthma flare, it's natural to worry that he's in serious trouble or wonder if he just needs a tweak to his medicine. That's where an action plan can help. Most use a simple system that's set up like a traffic light: green for ""go,"" yellow for ""caution,"" and red for ""stop -- danger!"" These days, many doctors instead ask you to watch your child's behavior and look for specific signs to see which zone he's in."
What are the odds you'll need another surgery after you get an artificial knee?,"Almost nine out of 10 people find that their new body part holds up for at least 20 years. More than two-thirds of these operations are done within the first year, usually because the joint gets infected. Repeat surgeries that happen later more often involve a loose implant, which can be painful or can leave your knee unstable. Always keep a watch on your artificial joint. If you suddenly have pain, swelling, and trouble moving, call your surgeon."
What does the diastolic blood pressure number mean?,"The diastolic reading, or the bottom number, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. This is the time when the heart fills with blood and gets oxygen. A normal diastolic blood pressure is lower than 80. Keeping track of blood pressure at home is important for many people, especially if you have high blood pressure."
How do I know if I have high blood pressure?,"But even if your diastolic number is lower than 80, you can have elevated blood pressure if the systolic reading is 120-129. That's why it's often called the ""silent killer."" The first symptom of untreated high blood pressure may be a heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage"
How should you measure your blood pressure at home?,"The stress of being in a doctor's office raises your blood pressure, but when you're home, it's normal. Ask your doctor or nurse to show you the right way to position your arm so you get accurate readings. Check it at the same time of day so the readings are consistent. Then, take several readings about 1 minute apart. Be sure to write down the results. Take the blood pressure journal to your doctor's office so you can talk about any changes in your numbers. Your doctor will decide whether you need medications."
How often should I get my blood pressure checked?,"If your blood pressure is normal (less than 120/80), get it checked every year or more frequently as your doctor suggests. If your blood pressure is elevated -- systolic blood pressure between 120 and 129 or diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 -- your doctor will probably want to check it every 3-6 months. It depends on what other health conditions or risk factors you have. Your doctor will decide whether you need medications. Even if your blood pressure is high, you probably won't have symptoms."
What does the systolic blood pressure number mean?,"This force creates pressure on those blood vessels, and that's your systolic blood pressure. A normal systolic pressure is below 120. 140 or more is stage 2 hypertension. The diastolic reading, or the bottom number, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats."
What are blood pressure numbers called?,Doctors call them systolic (the top number) and diastolic (the bottom number) blood pressure. Knowing both is important and could save your life. Take the blood pressure journal to your doctor's office so you can talk about any changes in your numbers.
"How often should I brush, floss, and rinse for my oral health care?","These activities remove plaque, which if not removed, combines with sugars to form acids that lead to tooth decay. Bacterial plaque also causes gum disease and other periodontal diseases. Antibacterial mouth rinses also reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease, and fluoride mouth rinse can help prevent tooth decay. If you do snack, brush teeth afterward or chew sugarless gum."
What are symptoms of colorectal cancer?,"The earliest sign of colorectal cancer may be bleeding. Other symptoms to look out for if you suspect colon cancer include: Change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) Unusual stomach or gas pains Very narrow stool A feeling that the bowel has not emptied completely after passing stool Unexplained weight loss Fatigue An adenoma is a benign, or non-cancerous polyp or growth in the lining of the large intestine."
How is estrogen related to postpartum depression?,"Is it too much estrogen? However, 10% to 25% of women experience a major depression within the first six months after childbirth. The abrupt drop in estrogen after delivery seems like the obvious culprit -- but this link has never been proved. Postpartum depression is treated like any other depression, with antidepressants, therapy, or both. Some preparations of estrogen do show promise as a potential add-on to these established treatments."
How is estrogen related to premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)?,"As many as 90% of women experience unpleasant symptoms before their periods. Some experts consider premenstrual dysphoric disorder to be a severe form of PMS. In PMDD, mood symptoms are more severe and often overshadow physical symptoms. The emotional disturbances are significant enough to cause problems with daily life. From 3% to 9% of women experience premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Estrogen appears to be involved in these mood disturbances, but exactly how is more of a mystery. Estrogen levels in women with PMS or PMDD are almost always normal. The problem may instead lie in the way estrogen ""talks"" to the parts of the brain involved in mood. Women with PMS or PMDD may also be more affected by the normal fluctuations of estrogen during the menstrual cycle."
What are the effects of estrogen on the brain?,"Not enough? Some of estrogen's effects include: Increasing serotonin, and the number of serotonin receptors in the brain. Modifying the production and the effects of endorphins, the ""feel-good"" chemicals in the brain. Protecting nerves from damage, and possibly stimulating nerve growth. What these effects mean in an individual woman is impossible to predict. Estrogen's actions are too complex for researchers to understand fully. As an example, despite estrogen's apparently positive effects on the brain, many women's moods improve after menopause, when estrogen levels are very low. Some experts believe that some women are more vulnerable to the menstrual cycle's normal changes in estrogen. They suggest it's the roller coaster of hormones during the reproductive years that create mood disturbances. The problem may instead lie in the way estrogen ""talks"" to the parts of the brain involved in mood."
What are normal estrogen levels?,"During the rest of the month, estrogen levels climb and fall gradually. Normal estrogen levels vary widely. Large differences are typical in a woman on different days, or between two women on the same day of their cycles. The actual measured level of estrogen doesn't predict emotional disturbances.

You can have either primary, secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is when your adrenal glands are damaged and can't make the cortisol you need. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is more common than Addison's disease. The condition happens because of a problem with your pituitary gland, a pea-sized bulge at the base of your brain. It makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropin ( ACTH). This is the chemical that signals your adrenal glands to make cortisol when your body needs it. If your adrenal glands don't get that message, they may eventually shrink. Tertiary starts in the hypothalamus, which is a small area located near the pituitary. It makes a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH) which tells the pituitary to make ACTH. When the hypothalamus is not making enough CRH, then it affects the pituitary's ability to produce ACTH , in turn keeping the adrenal glands from producing enough cortisol."

If lesions form in certain spots in your brain, they can affect how it makes dopamine. Over time, they may become less effective."
What medicines are used to treat Parkinsonâs disease?,"It's also an option to treat another type called relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines for relapse-remitting MS include beta interferons as well as: Alemtuzumab ( Lemtrada) Cladribine ( Mavenclad) Dimethyl fumarate ( Tecfidera) Fingolimod ( Gilenya) Glatiramer acetate ( Copaxone) Natalizumab ( Tysabri) Siponimod ( Mayzent) Teriflunomide ( Aubagio) Medications to treat Parkinson's either raise your dopamine levels or offer a substitute. Anticholinergic drugs to help control tremors Carbidopa-levodopa, or an infusion of both drugs called Duopa, to help boost dopamine levels COMT inhibitors like entacapone ( Comtan) or tolcapone ( Tasmar), to help drugs that boost dopamine levels work better Dopamine agonists: pramipexole ( Mirapex, Mirapex ER), ropinirole ( Requip, Requip XL), and rotigotine ( Neupro) to mimic the way dopamine works in your brain."

That means your body's immune system goes haywire for some reason. In Parkinson's, certain brain cells start to die off. Your brain makes less and less of a chemical called dopamine that helps control your movement. As your levels dip, you lose more of this control."
What does menorrhagia mean?,"These tumors, usually benign, are generally found in the smooth muscles of the uterus, and can cause pelvic pain, infertility, and heavy menstrual bleeding. In many cases, the bleeding has a known cause, like uterine fibroids (see above), but in other cases the cause remains unknown.

What are the symptoms of ocular albinism?,"The condition affects the retina and the nerves behind the eyes. The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that sends the brain signals about what a person sees. Things look blurry because the retina doesn't develop the way it should. It can't make a sharp image and the nerves behind the eyes can't transmit a clear image to the brain. Another symptom is the way the eyes look. Albinism keeps the body from making enough of a chemical called melanin, which gives eyes, skin, and hair their color. Most people with ocular albinism have blue eyes. But the blood vessels inside can show through the colored part (the iris), and the eyes can look pink or red. Other eye symptoms include: Quick eye movements that can't be controlled. Eyes that look in different directions."

What is creatinine and creatinine clearance?,"Creatinine is a waste product from the normal breakdown of muscle tissue. The amount of blood the kidneys can make creatinine-free each minute is called the creatinine clearance. Creatinine clearance in a healthy young person is about 95 milliliters per minute for women/120 milliliters per minute for men. This means that each minute, that person's kidneys clear 95-120 m L of blood free of creatinine. The GFR can vary depending on age, sex, and size. Generally, the creatinine clearance is a good estimation of the glomerular filtration rate. Testing the rate of creatinine clearance shows the kidneys' ability to filter the blood."
How do doctors determine the severity of chronic kidney disease relative to creatinine?,"The rate of blood flow through the kidneys is the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. Doctors determine the severity of chronic kidney disease with a staging system that uses GFR: Stage 1: GFR 90 or greater (normal kidney function) Stage 2: GFR 60-89 (mild decline in kidney function) Stage 3a: GFR 45 - 59 (mild to moderate decline in kidney function) Stage 3b GFR 30 - 44 (moderate to severe decline in kidney function) Stage 4: GFR 15-29 (severe decline in kidney function) Stage 5: GFR less than 15 (kidney failure, usually requiring dialysis) People over age 60 may have an apparently normal creatinine blood level, but still have a low GFR and creatinine clearance. The 24-hour urine collection method, or one of the GFR estimation formulas, can more accurately identify the decline in kidney function."
What should I know about creatinine and creatinine clearance blood tests?,"Doctors measure the blood creatinine level as a test of kidney function. The kidneys' ability to handle creatinine is called the creatinine clearance rate, which helps to estimate the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) -- the rate of blood flow through the kidneys. The fluid and waste products that the kidneys don't reabsorb are excreted as urine. Creatinine is a waste product that is produced continuously during normal muscle breakdown."

To determine the prostate cancer survival rate, these men are subtracted out of the calculations. Counting only the men who are left provides what's called the relative survival rate for prostate cancer. Taking that into consideration, the relative survival rates for most kinds of prostate cancer are actually pretty good. What about longer-term survival rates?"
What are the survival rates for prostate cancer?,"Over, say, five years, many of these men will die from other medical problems unrelated to prostate cancer. Almost 100% of men who have local or regional prostate cancer will survive more than five years after diagnosis.

As we've mentioned, in terms of survival rates, men with prostate cancer can be divided into two groups: Men with prostate cancer that is localized to the prostate or just nearby. Men whose prostate cancer has spread to distant areas, like their bones. Fewer of these men -- about one-third -- will survive their prostate cancer for more than five years."
"What are the survival rates for prostate cancer, according to staging?","As cancer diagnoses go, prostate cancer is often a less serious one. And these are just the men who are diagnosed.

As we've mentioned, in terms of survival rates, men with prostate cancer can be divided into two groups: Men with prostate cancer that is localized to the prostate or just nearby. These men have a high long-term survival rate for their prostate cancer. Almost all will survive their prostate cancer for longer than five years -- and well beyond for many men. Men whose prostate cancer has spread to distant areas, like their bones. These men may need more aggressive treatment for their prostate cancer. Fewer of these men -- about one-third -- will survive their prostate cancer for more than five years."

If you have an earache, discharge or trouble hearing, see your doctor. He will decide if you need antibiotics to help prevent mastoiditis and other serious health complications."
How is surgery done to treat mastoiditis?,"Surgery may also be needed to drain the fluid from the middle ear, called a myringotomy. During a myringotomy, the doctor makes a small hole in the eardrum to drain the fluid and relieve pressure from the middle ear. A small tube may be inserted into the middle ear to to keep the hole from closing so as to allow for continued drainage. This is called a mastoidectomy."

How will your doctor know if you have breast cancer hormone receptors?,"If it does, she may call it ""hormone-receptor positive,"" â ER-positive,â or â PR-positive.â For advanced cases, your doctor may want to repeat these tests after a while to see if the disease has changed. It may respond differently to hormones than before. The results will help your doctor find the best treatment at any stage. Lab tests will show if the disease has hormone receptors."
How can hormones play a role in breast cancer?,"These tumors have a sort of biological on-off switch called a hormone receptor. Estrogen and progesterone can flip these switches ""on"" and quicken the cancer cells' growth. If you have an HR-positive breast cancer, your doctor may prescribe drugs that target certain hormones your body makes. If your cancer is only â ER-positiveâ (sensitive to estrogen) or only â PR-positiveâ (sensitive to progesterone) -- not both -- it may still respond to hormone treatments."
How can your breast cancer hormone receptor test results affect your treatment?,"A percentage of cells out of 100 that have hormone receptors. Some lower the amount of those hormones that your body makes. Others block the effects of hormones in breast tissue or in other places where the cancer may have spread. In general, the more receptors you have and the greater their intensity, the more likely it is that hormone treatments will work. If your cancer is only â ER-positiveâ (sensitive to estrogen) or only â PR-positiveâ (sensitive to progesterone) -- not both -- it may still respond to hormone treatments. If your disease is both ER-negative and PR-negative, hormone therapy is unlikely to work. Another type of treatment may work better. Your doctor will find the best options with the fewest side effects and talk with you about the benefits and risks of each."

The vessels widen and blood flows through more easily. Your blood pressure lowers. Your heart receives more blood and oxygen, so it doesn't have to work so hard to pump."
How do beta-blockers work in treating heart disease?,"Your heart doesn't have to work so hard to pump blood through your vessels. Examples of ARBs include: Irbesartan ( Avapro) Losartan ( Cozaar) Telmisartan ( Micardis) Valsartan ( Diovan) This type of heart disease medicine can help in these ways: Makes your heart beat more slowly Makes the heart beat with less force Lowers your blood pressure Helps prevent future heart attacks if you have already had one Relieves chest pain Helps your heart beat more steadily How do beta-blockers accomplish all this? They prevent the hormone adrenaline from working. When adrenaline is blocked, your heartbeat slows down. Your heart can't pump so hard. This makes blood go through your vessels with less force. The pressure inside your blood vessels drops."
How can vasodilators help with treating heart disease?,"You may also use an ARB if you cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors due to a cough, a common side effect. Vasodilator heart disease medicine has two effects: Lowers blood pressure Eases chest pain (angina) Vasodilators relax the muscles in the blood vessel walls."

While foods don't appear to cause Crohn's disease, soft, bland foods may cause less discomfort than spicy or high-fiber foods when the disease is active."
What are life-threatening symptoms of Crohn's disease?,"You'd notice swelling, tenderness, pain, and fever. These drugs cause a higher risk of infections that can be life-threatening."
What medications are used to treat Crohn's disease?,"About 20% of people with Crohn's disease may have a close relative with either Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. Medication Crohn's disease is treated primarily with medications, including: Anti-inflammatory drugs. Examples include mesalamine ( Asacol, Lialda, Pentasa), olsalazine ( Dipentum), and sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine). Side effects include upset stomach, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and rash. Corticosteroids, a more powerful type of anti-inflammatory drug. Examples include budesonide ( Entocort) and prednisone or methylprednisolone ( Solu- Medrol). If you take these for a long time, side effects can be severe and may include bone thinning, muscle loss, skin problems, and a higher risk of infection. Entocort has fewer side effects. Immune system modifiers such as azathioprine ( Imuran) and methotrexate ( Rheumatrex). It can take up to 6 months for these drugs to work. These drugs cause a higher risk of infections that can be life-threatening. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin ( Cipro), metronidazole ( Flagyl), and others. Flagyl can cause a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, and tingling or numbness of the hands and feet. Cipro can cause nausea and tears in the Achilles tendon. Drugs for diarrhea. Biologic medicines, such as adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia), infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), natalizumab ( Tysabri), ustekinumab ( Stelara), and vedolizumab ( Entyvio). Once you start treatment, your doctor will check to see how well it works within several weeks. You'll continue until you reach remission. When that happens, your doctor may prescribe what he calls ""maintenance therapy"" to keep your symptoms at bay. Your doctor may suggest you take nutritional supplements, too."
How does Crohn's disease cause inflammation?,"It can get inflamed as a result of Crohn's treatment or the disease itself. Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can result from both gallstones and medications. The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. It has often been thought of as an autoimmune disease, but research suggests that the chronic inflammation may not be due to the immune system attacking the body itself, but rather a result of the immune system attacking a harmless virus, bacteria, or food in the gut."
How is Crohn's disease diagnosed?,"First, your doctor will review your medical history and talk about your symptoms. Your doctor might want to do some lab tests, like: Blood tests, including blood counts Stool samples to rule out infections as the cause of diarrhea Imaging tests or endoscopy: Your doctor might send you to a specialist called a gastroenterologist to get one of these: Balloon-assisted enteroscopy: This test uses balloons that inflate and deflate to pull a flexible tube called an endoscope through your small intestine. Capsule endoscopy : You'll swallow a tiny, pill-sized camera to give the doctor a closer look at your small intestine. Upper endoscopy: The doctor does this to see your esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum."
What other symptoms of Crohn's disease can develop?,"The symptoms depend on where the disease happens and how severe it is. Fistulas: In addition to forming within your intestines, fistulas can also form between the intestine and other organs, like the bladder or ureter."
How does diet affect Crohn's disease?,"Ileostomy: You might need this if your rectum is diseased and the doctor can't use it for an anastomosis. While foods don't appear to cause Crohn's disease, soft, bland foods may cause less discomfort than spicy or high-fiber foods when the disease is active. Most doctors try to be flexible in planning the diets of their Crohn's disease patients."

How can you give a cold to someone else?,Your sneezes and coughs can send virus particles as far as 12 feet through the air where they can land in someone's mouth or nose or be inhaled into the lungs. Others can also catch your cold if they touch you or something you've come into contact with and then touch their mouth or nose. Some people never show symptoms but can still give it to others.
What is heart valve disease?,"Your valves sit at the exit of each of your four heart chambers. They keep blood flowing through your heart. Your aortic valve narrows. It slows blood flow from your heart to the rest of your body. Mitral valve insufficiency. This causes blood to leak backward, leading to fluid backup in the lungs. The valve between your left upper and left lower chambers doesn't close right."
What should you know about pancreatic cancer?,"Unfortunately, a cure is rarely possible at that point. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer usually happens when someone comes to the doctor after experiencing weeks or months of symptoms. However, blood tests don't allow for early detection of pancreatic cancer, because these levels may not rise until pancreatic cancer is advanced, if at all."
Is pancreatic cancer curable?,"Unfortunately, a cure is rarely possible at that point. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer usually happens when someone comes to the doctor after experiencing weeks or months of symptoms. However, blood tests don't allow for early detection of pancreatic cancer, because these levels may not rise until pancreatic cancer is advanced, if at all."
How can getting tested prevent gonorrhea?,"Have your sexual partners get tested. Ask them if they've been screened for gonorrhea. If they haven't, have a conversation about getting tested.

What is meralgia paresthetica?,"You might also hear it called Bernhardt- Roth syndrome. It happens when there's too much pressure on or damage to one of the nerves in your leg, specifically the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. If you have meralgia paresthetica, a large sensory nerve in your outer thigh doesn't have enough room to pass through your hip bone or joints."
What are the warning signs and symptoms of meralgia paresthetica?,"You might feel: Pain, tingling, numbness, or burning in the outside of your thigh Sensitivity to light touch rather than to firm pressure High sensitivity to heat Your symptoms may be mild at first, but as the condition gets worse, you might feel sharper, shooting pain. It may go away and come back for no clear reason. The type of therapy you get depends on the cause of your condition."

The type of therapy you get depends on the cause of your condition."
What is an electromyography test for meralgia paresthetica?,"A certain set of nerves, called the sensory nerves, gather and send signals to your brain about your skin, muscles, and other tissues. If you have meralgia paresthetica, a large sensory nerve in your outer thigh doesn't have enough room to pass through your hip bone or joints. The doctor will touch your leg to find the affected area."
What is hyperthermia or heat stroke in dogs?,"The normal body temperature for dogs is between 101 and 102.5 F, compared to 97.6 to 99.6 F for humans. When dogs have high temperatures that are the result of hot external temperatures or excessive exercise in humid conditions, the condition is referred to as hyperthermia or heat stroke. When temperatures reach 106 F, serious and fatal complications can occur."
What illnesses or conditions can give your dog a high fever?,"Infection may be anywhere in the body, such as the lungs (pneumonia), the kidneys (pyelonephritis), the brain (encephalitis), or even the skin. Some infections, such as fungal diseases, can affect several areas of the body at the same time. Vaccination. A low-grade fever for 24 to 48 hours after vaccination is not uncommon and results from the interaction between the injection and the dog’s immune system. Toxins. Consuming substances that are poisonous to dogs, including macadamia nuts and some human antidepressants, can result in increased body temperature. If your dog has a temperature greater than 103 F, you should call your veterinarian."
How can I check if my dogs has a high fever?,"A temperature of more than 103 F is considered a dog fever, although it can be 103 if a dog is very excited or stressed. Although there are no definite signs, some symptoms that might indicate illness and fever in dogs include: Lethargy Depressed mood Shivering Loss of appetite Vomiting Coughing Nasal discharge The only accurate way to tell if your dog has an increased body temperature is to take his rectal temperature. Experts recommend using a digital thermometer specifically designed for rectal use in dogs. Most thermometers intended for use in human ears do not work well for this purpose. To take your dog’s temperature, first coat the thermometer with a lubricant such as petroleum gel or baby oil. Next, gently insert the thermometer about one inch into your dog’s anus and wait for results."
What are the symptoms of vaginal cysts?,"If you have one of these cysts, you might feel a small lump along the vaginal wall or on the lips. Often, your gynecologist will discover the lump during your annual exam. The cyst might stay the same size or grow larger. The cyst shouldn't be painful. However, some larger cysts -- especially Bartholin's gland cysts -- can cause discomfort when you walk, have sex, or insert a tampon. Vaginal cysts usually don't need to be treated."
How do you drain vaginal cysts?,"You might need to have a biopsy of the cyst to rule out cancer. During a biopsy, your health care provider removes a piece of tissue from the cyst. You could also have a procedure called marsupialization in which a small incision is made in the cyst to drain the fluid and then the edges of the incision are sutured to the sides of the incision."
How do you treat vaginal cysts?,"They're not usually harmful or painful. Vaginal cysts usually don't cause symptoms. You might need to have a biopsy of the cyst to rule out cancer.

Therefore, to be eligible for the biventricular pacemaker, heart failure patients must: Have severe or moderately severe heart failure symptoms Be taking medications to treat heart failure Have the type of heart rhythm problems mentioned above (your doctor can usually determine this using ECG testing) In addition, the heart failure patient may or may not need this type of pacemaker to treat slow heart rhythms and may or may not need an internal defibrillator (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD), which is designed to treat people at risk for sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrests."
How often should someone get their pacemaker checked?,"Because it is very important to keep the area of insertion sterile to prevent infection, your chest will be shaved (if necessary) and cleansed with a special soap. Activities such as golf, tennis, and swimming should be avoided for six weeks after the pacemaker is implanted. The nurse will explain how to check your pacemaker using the telephone transmitter. When the battery gets low, you will need to replace the pacemaker. Here is an outline of the pacemaker follow-up schedule: Check before you are discharged from the hospital, the day after implant Telephone call two weeks after implantation to make sure the wound is healing and to ensure the transmitter is working Six-week check Telephone checks every three to six months starting three months after your six-week check Pacemaker analysis every three to six months (in between telephone checks) Pacemakers usually last four to eight years."

Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and expose it to different allergens. That way, you don't have to be exposed to what may be the cause. To confirm a skin or blood test, or to see if a child has outgrown an allergy. It can be used to eliminate a specific food from the list, too. For this test, you'll go to your doctors' office or a hospital. Never try this type of test on your own, because it can cause a serious reaction."
How will I be tested for food allergies?,"First, he'll puts a small drop of liquid containing the food on your skin, and pricks it. Then he'll watch for a reaction -- a small bump that may get red like a mosquito bite. If your skin reacts, you're probably allergic to that food. Your doctor can talk with you about other treatment options. If you don't react, you're probably not allergic to it. This test is usually sent to a lab, and results could take a week or more. Your doctor will give you food samples and watch for a reaction."
How can blood tests help identify food allergies?,"You won't learn the results right away. This test is usually sent to a lab, and results could take a week or more. Doctors don't use it as often. They may use it if they have an idea of what you're allergic to. That way, you don't have to be exposed to what may be the cause. Neither skin nor blood tests can accurately predict how severe a food allergy reaction may be. Your doctor will give you food samples and watch for a reaction."
How can I know if I'm allergic to a food?,"First, he'll ask you questions about what you think you're allergic to and your symptoms. Sometimes that's enough to pinpoint the problem food, or he may suggest some tests. Allergy testing can help your doctor find out what you're allergic to, but it's not foolproof. After your tests are done, you'll need to work with him to get the right diagnosis. To confirm a skin or blood test, or to see if a child has outgrown an allergy."

Never bite off your baby's nails -- you could give her an infection."
What are hydrogenated fats?,"Coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils are exceptions to the rule; these liquid vegetable oils are highly saturated fats. This process also rearranges the molecular shape of the remaining unsaturated fats. The resulting shape is an abnormal ""trans"" shape."
Which fats are saturated?,"Less than 10 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fats. In general, the harder a fat, the more saturated it is. Beef and dairy fats are mostly saturated fats. Liquid oils are usually unsaturated fats, including monounsaturated fats in olive and canola oils and polyunsaturated fats in safflower, corn, soybean, and fish oils. Coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils are exceptions to the rule; these liquid vegetable oils are highly saturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise blood cholesterol levels and increase heart disease risk even more than saturated fats."
Is shingles is contagious?,"Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the virus that also causes chickenpox.

How often do people get infected by a brain-eating amoeba?,"N. fowleri disease is known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis ( PAM). It occurs from zero to eight times a year, almost always from July to September. A study in Virginia that looked at more than 16,000 autopsy records from patients who died of meningitis found five previously unreported cases of PAM. Studies show that many people may have antibodies to N. fowleri. That suggests that they became infected with the amoeba but that their immune systems fought it off. It's not at all clear whether N. fowleri is a rare infection that always causes PAM and is almost always fatal, or a more common infection that only sometimes causes PAM."
What is a brain-eating amoeba?,"Amoebas are single-celled organisms. The so-called brain-eating amoeba is a species discovered in 1965. It's formal name is Naegleria fowleri. Although first identified in Australia, this amoeba is believed to have evolved in the U. S. There are several species of Naegleria but only the fowleri species causes human disease. By comparison, a hair is 40 to 50 micrometers wide. When conditions are favorable, the cysts turn into trophozoites -- the feeding form of the amoeba. But brains are accidental food for them. According to the CDC, N. fowleri normally eats bacteria."

Treatment varies depending on the location of the meningioma and the symptoms it causes. Symptoms may include headache and weakness on one side, seizures, personality changes, and visual problems. Sometimes the doctor will choose to watch the tumor for a time. If surgery is needed, its success depends on your age, the location of the tumor, and whether it is attached to anything. Radiation treatment may be used for tumors that can't be removed. Myomas are tumors that grow from muscle."
What are fibromas?,"Fibroids commonly grow in the uterus. Although not cancerous, uterine fibroids can lead to heavy vaginal bleeding, bladder problems, or pelvic pain or pressure.

The third type has some symptoms from each of the other two and is called the combined type. When one person is diagnosed with ADHD, there is a 25%-35% chance that another family member will also have the condition, compared to 4%-6% of the general public."
Is ADHD more common in girls or boys?,"Each one is identified by the symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. Inattentiveness is a hallmark of ADHD in girls, but because they aren't often disruptive in the classroom, they may be harder to diagnose."

Wear loose items that don't rub against your skin."
Why does someone get eczema?,"A weak or haywire immune system can cause a flare-up. Healthy, supple skin protects you. If yours gets too dry, it may not be able to block out tiny bacteria or allergens that cause eczema. Some people are more likely to get eczema than others. This includes African- Americans, people who work in health care or childcare, and those who live in cold climates or cities with lots of air pollution. Eczema is common in babies and kids. You may just call it sensitive skin. You might grow out of it or you could have it on and off for life. It pays to figure out what causes your skin to react. These are common eczema triggers."
How does a doctor diagnose and treat eczema?,"Your doctor can tell if you have eczema based on your symptoms, medical and family history, and what seems to trigger your outbreaks. You may need to see a dermatologist -- a doctor who specializes in skin conditions. There's no test to prove that you have eczema. Your symptoms, age, family history, other health problems, and lifestyle help you find treatments that work. Most eczema treatments give you short-term relief.

What is HER2-negative breast cancer?,"A gene called HER2 makes too many copies of itself in about 20% of people with breast cancer. If you have that faulty version of the gene, your disease is called "" HER2-positive."" You'll need different treatments."
What medications can help treat HER2 positive breast cancer?,"A gene called HER2 makes too many copies of itself in about 20% of people with breast cancer. Trastuzumab ( Herceptin) is the standard treatment for this type of breast cancer. Trastuzumab treats this type of breast cancer either alone or alone with chemotherapy drugs. Pertuzumab ( Perjeta) is another antibody that treats HER2-positive breast cancer. Pertuzumab may be harmful to a fetus, so women who are pregnant shouldn't take it. Another medication, ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla), combines the antibody in trastuzumab with a chemotherapy drug. Doctors give it to people with HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer who were already treated with trastuzumab. Lapatinib ( Tykerb) is an example of a small-molecule drug that you can take in a pill. Together with chemotherapy, it treats some advanced cases of HER2-positive breast cancer."
Does L-carnitine help improve fibromyalgia symptoms?,"If you want to take a natural approach to treating fibromyalgia, it's important to learn as much as you can about the therapies you consider. The studies are limited, but it's thought that L-carnitine may give some relief from fatigue in people with fibromyalgia. Some researchers have also concluded that while more studies are warranted, L-carnitine may provide support for the muscular system of patients with fibromyalgia."

High blood pressure is more likely in people with a family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes. Diet and lifestyle also play a big role in essential hypertension. The link between salt and high blood pressure is especially noteworthy. People living on the northern islands of Japan eat more salt than anyone else in the world. They're also most likely to get hypertension. Many people with high blood pressure are ""salt sensitive."" That means anything more a minimal amount will raise their blood pressure."
What blood pressure readings are too high?,"If yours is 180/120 or higher, get medical attention right away. Your doctor could also tell you that you have something called prehypertension. That's when your BP is just a bit higher than 120/less than 80. Many people with high blood pressure are ""salt sensitive."""
What is essential high blood pressure?,That's the force in the arteries when the heart beats. This is essential hypertension.
What are the side effects and precautions for alpha lipoic acid (ALA)?,"Advocates of ALA make claims that range from beneficial effects for treating conditions such as diabetes and HIV to enhancing weight loss. However, little is known about the possible effect of long-term use of ALA supplements. And there are no dosage recommendations and little data on the potential effect of large doses taken over time. ALA should not be used without a recommendation from your doctor if you take insulin or other medications to lower blood sugar. It's possible that it can enhance the effect of these drugs, leading to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Discuss the use of supplemental ALA with your doctor first. Your doctor may recommend that you increase monitoring of blood sugar levels. The doctor may also want to make an adjustment in your medication. Because no studies have been done on the effect of using ALA during pregnancy, you should not use it if pregnant. Also, there are no data about its use by children, so children should not take ALA supplements."
"What are high-protein, low-carb diets?","!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } By comparison, the American Heart Association, the National Cholesterol Education Program, and the American Cancer Society all recommend a diet in which a smaller percentage of calories come from protein. The American Heart Association recommends getting 10% - 35% of your daily calories from protein. This is about 46 grams of protein for adult women and 56 grams for adult men. Some experts have raised concern about high-protein, low-carb diets."
"What are the risks of high protein, low carb diets?","High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, like The Atkins Diet, have been widely promoted as effective weight loss plans. High cholesterol. Some protein sources -- like fatty cuts of meat, whole dairy products, and other high-fat foods -- can raise cholesterol, increasing your chance of heart disease. However, studies showed that people on the Atkins diet for up to 2 years actually had decreased âbadâ cholesterol levels. Kidney problems. If you have any kidney problems, eating too much protein puts added strain on your kidneys. This could worsen kidney function. Osteoporosis and kidney stones. When you're on a high-protein diet, you may urinate more calcium than normal. There are conflicting reports, but some experts think this could make osteoporosis and kidney stones more likely."
Who shouldn't take diuretics (water pills) for high blood pressure?,"Some diuretics are sulfa drugs, so they could cause a reaction if you're allergic. Older people tend to have more side effects such as fainting and dizziness from dehydration. You'll need to work closely with your doctor. Diuretics aren't recommended for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. We don't know how these drugs affect an unborn baby. But potassium-sparing diuretics can cause low levels of calcium, which could hurt bone development."
What are the side effects of diuretics (water pills) for high blood pressure?,"If you only need one dose a day, you might want to take your diuretic in the morning so you can sleep through the night instead of getting up to go to the bathroom. You also run the risk of getting dehydrated, and simply drinking more fluids may not be enough. Call your doctor if you're very thirsty or have a very dry mouth, your pee is a deep yellow, you aren't peeing much or get constipated, or you have a bad headache. You may feel dizzy or lightheaded, especially when you stand up, if your blood pressure has dropped too low, or you're getting dehydrated. Your blood chemistry can get thrown off. You could have too little or too much sodium or potassium in your system. This can make you tired or weak or give you muscle cramps or a headache. It's rare, but your heart may speed up (over 100 beats a minute) or you might start throwing up because of a dangerously low potassium level. Diuretics may make it harder for you to control your blood sugar, which can lead to diabetes if you don't already have it. You might be more likely to get gout. Taking combination pills or multiple medicines could boost these side effects. To help lower those odds, ask your doctor when during the day you should take each medication."
What are diuretics (water pills) for high blood pressure?,"Because you have less total fluid in your blood vessels, like a garden hose that's not turned on all the way, the pressure inside will be lower. This also makes it easier for your heart to pump. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } They're usually the first type of medication that your doctor will try to control your blood pressure.

Can your immune system work against you?,"You've heard of your immune system. It's made up of tissues, cells, and organs, including: Your tonsils Your digestive system Your bone marrow Your skin Your lymph nodes Your spleen Thin skin on the inside of your nose, throat, and genitals All of these help create or store cells that work around the clock to keep your whole body healthy. They turn on your immune system by introducing your body to a tiny amount of a virus (usually a killed or weakened one). Your immune system can become less effective as you get older. It can also make you more likely to get an autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis, or even some kinds of cancer."
How can I get calcium and vitamin D to help with osteoporosis?,"Without calcium and vitamin D the drugs can't do their job. Whether you get them as a part of your regular diet or through supplements, these essential nutrients are key. If you still aren't getting enough calcium and vitamin D, then ask your doctor about supplements. If your doctor says you have osteopenia, treat it as a warning sign -- a chance to practice good bone health by eating a calcium-rich diet, taking supplements if needed, and getting regular exercise."
How is tuberculosis treated?,"What medications you take and how long you'll have to take them depends on which works to eradicate your TB. Sometimes, antibiotics used to treat the disease don't work. Doctors call this ""drug-resistant"" TB. If you have this form of the disease, you may need to take stronger medications for longer. That's why your doctor might prescribe medication to kill the inactive bacteria -- just in case. These are the three treatment options: Isoniazid ( INH): This is the most common therapy for latent TB. If you have this form of the disease, you'll need to take a number of antibiotics for 6 to 9 months."

Symptoms include: Trouble breathing or throat feels like its closing Confusion Cramping Dizziness or fainting Hives covering much of the body Irregular heartbeat Shock or unconsciousness If you have any of these symptoms, call 911. Use an epinephrine shot if you have one, and take antihistamines to help slow down the reaction. Even if the reaction goes away, you still need to go to the hospital."
What is the role of insulin in the cause of type 2 diabetes?,"It builds up in your bloodstream instead. When you eat or drink, much of the food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose. It moves through your bloodstream to these cells where it provides the energy your body needs for daily activities. Insulin and other hormones control the amount of glucose in your bloodstream. Your pancreas is always releasing small amounts of insulin. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, the pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into the cells. This causes the glucose levels in the blood (blood glucose levels) to drop. To keep blood glucose levels from getting too low (hypoglycemia or low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose from the stores kept in the liver."
Why do ear infections often accompany a cold or the flu?,"Germs that are growing in the nose or sinus cavities can climb up the Eustachian tube and enter the middle ear to start growing. The middle ear is a small space behind the ear drum that is supposed to be well ventilated by air that normally passes up from behind the nose, through the Eustachian tube, keeping the middle ear clean and dry."
What triggers an ear infection in children?,"The middle ear is a small space behind the ear drum that is supposed to be well ventilated by air that normally passes up from behind the nose, through the Eustachian tube, keeping the middle ear clean and dry. For children, the most common trigger of an ear infection is an upper respiratory viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. Bacteria can cause an ear infection directly, but usually these organisms come on the heels of a viral infection or an allergic reaction, quickly finding their way into the warm, moist environment of the middle ear. Invading bacteria can wreak major havoc, turning inflammation into infection and provoking fevers."
How is Paget's disease diagnosed?,"It may cause your bones to break and can lead to other health problems. It can be confused with arthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, or other changes that come with age. Some people only find out they have it because of an X-ray or blood test taken for a different reason. To see if you have Paget's disease of bone, your doctor will examine you and ask questions about your family history. He'll want pictures taken of your bones, because a bone with Paget's will look larger and thicker than usual. It can look like it didn't grow right."
Which tests may diagnose Paget's disease?,"To see if you have Paget's disease of bone, your doctor will examine you and ask questions about your family history. People who have Paget's often have more of this enzyme than normal, which reflects the bone turnover that is common in Paget's."

As mentioned, some herbal therapies can interact with other medications you may be taking."
What are the two types of surgical implants that help chronic pain?,"When they are used, which is rare, there are two main types of implants to control pain: Intrathecal Drug Delivery. Also called infusion pain pumps or spinal drug delivery systems. In spinal cord stimulation, low-level electrical signals are transmitted to the spinal cord or to specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. Two kinds of spinal cord stimulation systems are available."
What are dietary approaches to help treat chronic pain?,"Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or eating plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis. Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment."

For bursitis that's severe, long-lasting, or comes back often, she may try one of these more aggressive treatments: Aspiration: The doctor will drain extra fluid from the bursa sac inside your elbow joint. Steroid shot: Your doctor can inject steroids into the bursa to ease inflammation. The shot works faster and is stronger than taking the medication by mouth. Some doctors do this after they aspirate the bursa."
What are the treatments for antisperm antibodies?,"They can make it harder for couples to have a baby. But it's rare for antibodies by themselves to make it impossible to get pregnant. Less commonly, your doctor may check your cervical mucus for antisperm antibodies. That could lead to fewer antibodies and raise the chances that your female partner could get pregnant. For women, one treatment that's shown to help your chances of getting pregnant is intrauterine insemination."
What causes antisperm antibodies?,"It happens when the immune system mistakenly targets sperm in a man's semen as an invader and damages or kills it. This can also happen after a testicle surgery like a vasectomy. Women's bodies can make antisperm antibodies if they have an allergic reaction to semen. Antibodies in a woman's vagina kill the sperm. That's rare, and doctors don't know exactly why it happens."
What are antisperm antibodies?,"Like the name says, antisperm antibodies fight sperm. Both men and women can make them. They can make it harder for couples to have a baby. But it's rare for antibodies by themselves to make it impossible to get pregnant. In men, an infection in their prostate or an injury to their testicles can set off an immune response when the sperm comes in contact with blood. This allows the sperm to avoid contact with antisperm antibodies in your cervical mucus."
What causes restless legs syndrome?,"About 10% of people have restless legs syndrome, also called RLS. You should see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis of RLS and to exclude other conditions that may resemble RLS. Not enough iron in the diet is one cause of restless legs syndrome."
Who's most likely to get restless legs syndrome?,About 2% to 3% of them have moderate to severe symptoms that affect their quality of life. Also: Slightly more women than men get it.

Are there always warning signs before a heart attack?,"The condition may be detected by ECG (electrocardiogram) testing. People with diabetes often have silent ischemia. Other people mistake a heart attack for a symptom of the flu or reflux disease, which causes heartburn. Depending on the severity of a heart attack, a person may experience: Heart failure, where the heart doesn't pump well enough to meet the body's needs Arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms Cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death, where the heart stops beating Cardiogenic shock, where the heart is so damaged from the heart attack that a person goes into shock, which may result in damage of other vital organs like the kidneys or liver Death Most heart attacks are the result of coronary artery disease, also known as atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries,"" a condition that clogs coronary arteries with fatty, calcified plaques over time."
What is the outlook for heart attacks?,"But those who survive the initial heart attack and are free from major problems a few hours later stand a better chance of full recovery. Depending on the severity of a heart attack, a person may experience: Heart failure, where the heart doesn't pump well enough to meet the body's needs Arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms Cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death, where the heart stops beating Cardiogenic shock, where the heart is so damaged from the heart attack that a person goes into shock, which may result in damage of other vital organs like the kidneys or liver Death Most heart attacks are the result of coronary artery disease, also known as atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries,"" a condition that clogs coronary arteries with fatty, calcified plaques over time."
What is a heart attack?,"The heart has four main arteries, two of them large, branching arteries that deliver oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. If one of these arteries or branches becomes blocked suddenly, a portion of the heart is starved of oxygen, a condition called ""cardiac ischemia."" !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } If cardiac ischemia lasts too long, the starved heart tissue dies.

Is valerian a helpful sleep remedy?,"It is one of the leading natural supplements for managing anxiety and insomnia. But according to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Data Base there is not enough proof to say that it is effective in treating insomnia. Some limited findings show that valerian may reduce the time needed to fall asleep and may improve sleep quality. Unlike the benzodiazepines, most people feel no morning grogginess after taking valerian. Other findings were not as promising. They showed that when compared to a placebo, valerian didn't relieve anxiety or insomnia any better than the placebo. There is some support for the idea that using valerian over a period of time (such as over four weeks) may be more effective than taking it one night only. People who are poor sleepers may find more benefit that those who are normally good sleepers. Kava, also known as kava kava, is an herbal remedy that's used for stress and anxiety relief and insomnia."
Are there risks associated with taking melatonin as a natural sleep aid?,"Some people find that melatonin causes grogginess and depression. Others report falling asleep quickly with melatonin only to awaken in the middle of the night. Still, studies show that melatonin appears to be safe with short-term use (three months or less). Like all drugs, natural sleep remedies can have side effects and risks."
Is kava a safe natural sleep remedy?,"Kava, also known as kava kava, is an herbal remedy that's used for stress and anxiety relief and insomnia. Reports in Europe of more than 20 cases of cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver failure suggest the possibility of liver toxicity associated with its use."
What is the role of saliva in preventing tooth enamel erosion?,"Tooth erosion happens when acids wear away the enamel on teeth. Not only does saliva increase the health of the body tissues, it protects enamel by coating the teeth in protective calcium and other minerals. Saliva also dilutes erosive agents such as acid, removes waste material from the mouth, and boosts protective substances that help fight mouth bacteria and disease."
How does fluoride affect tooth enamel erosion?,"While fluoride is useful in preventing tooth decay, too much fluoride can cause problems like enamel fluorosis. Children with enamel fluorosis may have ingested too much fluoride through supplements, or they took fluoride supplements in addition to drinking fluoridated water. Also, swallowing fluoride toothpaste increases the chances of enamel fluorosis. Yet in some severe cases, the teeth are discolored, pitted, and difficult to keep clean."
How does tooth enamel protect your teeth?,"Enamel is the thin outer covering of the tooth. Enamel helps protect your teeth from daily use such as chewing, biting, crunching, and grinding. Although enamel is a hard protector of teeth, it can chip and crack. Enamel also insulates the teeth from potentially painful temperatures and chemicals. Because enamel has no living cells, the body cannot repair chipped or cracked enamel."
How can you prevent tooth enamel erosion?,"Enamel is the thin outer covering of the tooth. See your dentist every six months for regular checkups and cleaning. You can also try the following: Eliminate highly acidic foods and drinks from your diet such as carbonated sodas, lemons, and other citrus fruits and juices. Rinse your mouth immediately with clear water after eating acidic foods or drinking acidic drinks. The mouth is acidic for a few hours after eating foods high in sugar and starches. Avoid snacking unless you're able to rinse your mouth and brush teeth. Chew sugar-free gum between meals. Drink more water throughout the day if you have low saliva volume or dry mouth. Use fluoride toothpaste. Ask your dentist if sealants may be helpful in preventing enamel erosion and tooth decay."
What are signs of tooth enamel erosion?,"Enamel is the thin outer covering of the tooth. The edges of teeth become more rough, irregular, and jagged as enamel erodes. Indentations appear on the surface of the teeth. When enamel erodes, the tooth is more susceptible to cavities or tooth decay. When the tooth decay enters the hard enamel, it has entry to the main body of the tooth."
How does plaque cause tooth enamel erosion?,"Plaque is a sticky film made up of saliva, food particles, bacteria, and other substances. Plaque forms between your teeth and gets inside tiny holes or pits in the molars. When this happens, the acids in plaque start to eat away at the healthy minerals in the tooth enamel. This causes the enamel to wear down and become pitted."
What do I need to know about tooth enamel erosion and restoration?,"This tough shell is the hardest tissue in the human body. Because enamel is translucent, you can see light through it. But the main portion of the tooth, the dentin, is the part that's responsible for your tooth color -- whether white, off white, grey, or yellowish. Sometimes coffee, tea, cola, red wine, fruit juices, and cigarettes stain the enamel on your teeth.

Before it appears, you might notice a related condition called a pinguecula (pin- GWEK-yoo-la). This is a yellowish patch or bump on the conjunctiva and can get red if irritated."
What is surfer's eye?,"The growth might spread slowly during your life or stop after a certain point. In extreme cases, it can cover your pupil and cause vision problems. The growth could show up in one eye or both. When it affects both, it's known as a bilateral pterygium. Though it isn't usually a serious condition, it can cause annoying symptoms. You might feel like you have something in your eye. Or it may get red and irritated and require medical or surgical treatment. These include: Return of a more aggressive growth Scars Most of the time, doctors only suggest surgery if: Other treatments have failed Your eyesight is at risk The look of it bothers you One type of surgery uses your tissue from your conjunctiva or a placenta to fill the empty space after the lesion is gone. The growth is removed and the filler is glued or stitched onto the affected area."
What could happen after surgery for surfer's eye?,"See an eye doctor if you have any symptoms. These include: Return of a more aggressive growth Scars Most of the time, doctors only suggest surgery if: Other treatments have failed Your eyesight is at risk The look of it bothers you One type of surgery uses your tissue from your conjunctiva or a placenta to fill the empty space after the lesion is gone.

What is the TNM system for breast cancer?,"Breast cancer cells have spread far away from the breast and lymph nodes right around it. Doctors also group cancers by the letters T, N, or M. Each of those letters tells you something about your cancer. The higher the number assigned after it, the bigger or wider the mass. These small filters are found throughout the body, and they're especially dense in and around the breast. They're meant to catch cancer cells before they travel to other parts of the body. Here, too, a number (0- III) tells you whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breast and, if so, how many."
What is stage III breast cancer?,"The tumor itself is no larger than a shelled peanut, or there may be no tumor Stage IB means some cancer cells, but just tiny amounts, have been found in a few lymph nodes. The cancer has not spread to bones or organs, but it's considered advanced, and it's harder to fight. IIIA means the cancer has been found in up to nine of the lymph nodes that form a chain from your underarm to your collarbone. IIIB means the tumor has grown into the chest wall or skin around your breast, even if it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes. IIIC means cancer has been found in 10 or more lymph nodes, or has spread above or below your collarbone. It's also IIIC if fewer lymph nodes outside the breast are affected but those inside it are enlarged or cancerous."

What is metastatic brain cancer?,Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain. The cells spread to the brain from another tumor in a process called metastasis. This is the most common type of brain tumor.
What are benign tumors relative to brain cancer?,"Although such growths are popularly called brain tumors, not all brain tumors are cancer. But a benign tumor can still cause many problems in the brain by pressing on nearby tissue. This is the most common type of brain tumor."
How do primary brain tumors develop?,"Some brain cancers occur when one type of cell transforms from its normal characteristics. Once transformed, the cells grow and multiply in abnormal ways. As these abnormal cells grow, they become a mass, or tumor. The brain tumors that result are called primary brain tumors because they originate in the brain. Metastatic brain tumors are made of cancerous cells from a tumor elsewhere in the body."
Are all brain tumors cancerous?,"Although such growths are popularly called brain tumors, not all brain tumors are cancer. Malignant tumors can grow and spread aggressively, overpowering healthy cells by taking their space, blood, and nutrients. They can also spread to distant parts of the body. Like all cells of the body, tumor cells need blood and nutrients to survive. Tumors that do not invade nearby tissue or spread to distant areas are called benign. But a benign tumor can still cause many problems in the brain by pressing on nearby tissue. In the U. S., brain or nervous system tumors affect about 6 of every 1,000 people."
What is metastatic brain cancer made of?,Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain. The cells spread to the brain from another tumor in a process called metastasis. This is the most common type of brain tumor.
How do hormones play a role in the development of prostate cancer?,Men who consume large amounts of fat -- particularly from red meat and other sources of animal fat cooked at high heat -- may be more likely to develop advanced prostate cancer.

To confirm the diagnosis, the child may get a sleep study that's done in a special laboratory. Not every child with enlarged tonsils or with loud snoring has sleep apnea. Surgery is the treatment of choice for kids with enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Other treatments are available for those with restricted nighttime breathing due to allergies or other causes."
What are the most likely symptoms of endometrial cancer?,"The most likely symptoms are: Abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, which occurs in nine out of 10 women with endometrial cancer. Before menopause, this means unusually heavy irregular menstrual periods or bleeding between periods.

How are extreme cases of gastroparesis treated?,"You may have: Heartburn or reflux (backup of stomach contents into the esophagus) Nausea Vomiting (in severe cases, this may happen daily) Trouble controlling blood sugar Feeling full quickly when eating Abdominal bloating Poor appetite and weight loss Food that stays in your stomach too long can spoil and lead to the growth of bacteria. A surgeon will put a special tube through your abdominal wall directly into your small intestine. You ""eat"" specially made liquid meals through the tube instead of food going through your stomach."
How does electrical stimulation work in treating refractory epilepsy?,"Your doctor may also put a device under your skin that sends electrical signals to one of your nerves, called the vagus nerve. After it's done, you'll probably need to stay in an intensive care unit of the hospital for a few days. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you might have from the surgery. Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS). The doctor puts a device that looks like a heart pacemaker under your left collarbone. It connects to the vagus nerve in your neck through a wire that runs under your skin. The device sends a current to the nerve, which may cut down on the number of seizures you get or make them less intense."
How long does it take to recover from surgery for refractory epilepsy?,"After it's done, you'll probably need to stay in an intensive care unit of the hospital for a few days. You might need to stay on the drugs for the rest of your life. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you might have from the surgery. You can ask them to put you in touch with other people who've had the surgery, so you can better understand what to expect."
What are the symptoms of refractory epilepsy?,"Your seizures could take different forms and last from a few seconds to a few minutes. You may have convulsions, which means you can't stop your body from shaking. Do you still have seizures after taking medicine?"
What is refractory epilepsy?,"You might hear the condition called by some other names, such as uncontrolled, intractable, or drug-resistant epilepsy. You can have refractory epilepsy as an adult, or your child might have it. About 1 in 3 people with epilepsy will develop it.

How does moisturizing help dry skin?,"If you have dry skin, you should moisturize daily. Do it right after you shower, bathe, or wash your hands, while your skin is still damp. If you can tolerate the greasy feeling, choose a moisturizer that is thick, heavy, and gooey. Skin care experts say ointments (called emollients), such as petroleum jelly, are best. They help seal the skin and prevent water loss. But their greasy feel may be a turn-off for some people. Creams are the next best bet. Lotions are not quite as effective but often feel far better than creams and ointments on your skin. These products are mainly water-based, and the water quickly evaporates when applied to the skin. The moisturizer should be free of dyes, fragrances, and other possible irritants. Make sure the label says the product is hypoallergenic. This means the moisturizer is less likely to cause an allergic reaction, which can make you itch more. If a skin cream or ointment isn't handy, check your kitchen cupboard for a quick fix.

How can MRI-guided focal laser ablation be used to treat cancer?,"Advances in imaging may make it easier for doctors to learn about the cancer they're up against. Multiparametric-magnetic resonance imaging (mp- MRI), for instance, can uncover the jumble of blood vessels in a new prostate tumor."
How is the pulp removed from the tooth during a root canal?,"A hole can occur through the side of the tooth, with drainage into the gums or through the cheek into the skin. The pulp, along with bacteria and related debris, is removed from the tooth. The cleaning-out process is accomplished using root canal files. A series of these files of increasing diameter are each subsequently placed into the access hole and worked down the full length of the tooth to scrape and scrub the sides of the root canals. Water or sodium hypochlorite is used periodically to flush away the debris."
What are the signs that a root canal therapy is needed?,Signs you may need root canal therapy include: Severe toothache pain upon chewing or application of pressure Prolonged sensitivity (pain) to hot or cold temperatures (after the heat or cold has been removed) Discoloration (darkening) of the tooth Swelling and tenderness in nearby gums A persistent or recurring pimple on the gums Sometimes no symptoms are present. Root canal therapy should relieve the pain you feel.
Why does dental pulp need to be removed?,"The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the center of the tooth and contains the nerve, blood vessels, and connective tissue. The bacteria and other dying pulp remnants can cause an infection or abscessed tooth. An abscess is a pus-filled pocket that forms at the end of a tooth's root."
What are ways to prevent the need for a root canal?,"A tooth's pulp can become irritated, inflamed, and infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth, large fillings, a crack or chip in the tooth, or trauma to the face. Trauma resulting from a sports-related injury can be reduced by wearing a mouth guard."
Is there an alternative to root canal procedure?,"The tooth's nerve is in the ""root"" or ""legs"" of the tooth. The tooth would then be replaced with a bridge, implant, or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting. These alternatives not only are more expensive than a root canal procedure but require more treatment time and additional procedures to adjacent teeth and supporting tissues."
What is the first step in the procedure for a root canal?,"In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause: Swelling that may spread to other areas of the face, neck, or head Bone loss around the tip of the root Drainage problems extending outward from the root. Your dentist or endodontist will then use local anesthesia to numb the area near the tooth. Actually, anesthesia may not be necessary, since the nerve is dead, but most dentists still anesthetize the area to make the patient more relaxed and at ease."
What is dental pulp?,"Root canal therapy is performed when the pulp which is composed of nerves and blood vessels in the tooth becomes infected or damaged. The tooth's nerve is in the ""root"" or ""legs"" of the tooth. The root canals travel from the tip of the tooth's root into the pulp chamber."
How successful is root canal treatment?,Root canal therapy is the treatment of choice. These alternatives not only are more expensive than a root canal procedure but require more treatment time and additional procedures to adjacent teeth and supporting tissues.
What causes infection after a root canal?,"Your dentist will discuss who might be best suited to perform the work in your particular case. Among the likely reasons for this include: More than the normally anticipated number of root canals in a tooth (leaving one of them uncleaned) An undetected crack in the root of a tooth A defective or inadequate dental restoration that has allowed bacteria to get past the restoration into the inner aspects of the tooth and recontaminate the area A breakdown of the inner sealing material over time, allowing bacteria to recontaminate the inner aspects of the tooth Sometimes re-treatment can be successful."
What should I look for in acne-friendly aftershave lotions?,"What to look for: Use a non-irritating, lubricating shaving gel, or a prescription shaving foam containing benzoyl peroxide or a topical antibiotic that's designed for men with acne.

This is the most concerning and potentially lethal side effect of pica Eating non-food objects can interfere with eating healthy food, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Eating objects that cannot be digested, such as stones, can cause constipation or blockages in the digestive tract, including the intestines and bowels. Also, hard or sharp objects (such as paperclips or metal scraps) can cause tears in the lining of the esophagus or intestines. Bacteria or parasites from dirt or other objects can cause serious infections. Some infections can damage the kidneys or liver. Co-existing developmental disabilities can make treatment difficult."
How is pica treated?,"The doctor may use certain tests -- such as X-rays and blood tests -- to check for anemia and look for toxins and other substances in the blood, and to check for blockages in the intestinal tract. Given the risk of medical complications (such as lead poisoning) associated with pica, close medical monitoring is necessary throughout treatment of the eating behavior. There are many potential complications of pica, such as: Certain items, such as paint chips, may contain lead or other toxic substances and eating them can lead to poisoning, increasing the child's risk of complications including learning disabilities and brain damage."
What is the outlook for people with pica?,"The doctor may use certain tests -- such as X-rays and blood tests -- to check for anemia and look for toxins and other substances in the blood, and to check for blockages in the intestinal tract. However, it is likely to be more difficult to manage in children who are developmentally disabled."
When is surgery a treatment option for Pancoast tumors?,"If the cancer has not spread to distant areas of the body, surgery will likely be offered. People with Pancoast tumors that are directly invading the covering of the lung and chest wall should generally undergo surgery, if: The cancer has not spread to distant parts of the body. The patient's heart and lungs are healthy enough to allow surgery. There is no evidence of extensive enlargement of the lymph nodes. Occasionally, people with severe pain who have tumors that can't be removed may be selectively considered for palliative surgery to reduce pain."
What is the outlook for people with Pancoast tumors?,"An MRI can also better assess the tumor's invasion of nearby areas. However, recent studies have shown that, in some people, the tumor completely stops growing and the pain is gone. In addition, survival rates have improved."
What is basal ganglia calcification?,"Most people who develop it are in good health before they find out they have it. When it happens this way, it is also known as basal ganglia calcification, but is different from the genetic form of the disease. If one of your brothers and sisters or a parent has it, it's more likely that your symptoms (if you have any) are part of the same syndrome. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of having it as well."
How is basal ganglia calcification diagnosed?,"Instead, doctors use several methods to see if you have it. They usually start with symptoms and family history. If one of your brothers and sisters or a parent has it, it's more likely that your symptoms (if you have any) are part of the same syndrome. There is no cure, but there is treatment for the symptoms."
How effective are diaphragms in preventing pregnancy?,"So if you put the diaphragm in hours ahead of time, remember to add more. That's more effective than condoms or other barrier methods, but less effective than sterilization, intrauterine devices ( IUDs), or birth control pills. And some women get urinary tract infections more often when they use a diaphragm. If it's in correctly, you and your partner can't feel it."

In this phase, researchers determine which study group has fewer side effects and is demonstrating the most improvement. Phase IV clinical trials, also called post-marketing studies, are conducted after a treatment has been approved. The purpose of these trials is to provide an opportunity to learn more details about the treatment and to address questions that may have come up during other phases of trials. This phase involves many more people and may identify side effects that were not previously reported during other phases. How does this study compare with standard treatment options?"

What is deep brain stimulation?,"In the 1960s, surgery was used to destroy a small area deep in the brain called the thalamus (thalamotomy) or another part of the brain called the globus pallidus (pallidotomy). These surgeries are still done today, although less frequently because of the availability of deep brain stimulation. These surgeries carry significant risks: both thalamotomy and pallidotomy require purposeful destruction of areas of the brain. If the surgeon is off by even a fraction of an inch, the surgery may not be effective and severe complications such as paralysis, loss of vision, or loss of speech can result. The FDA has approved DBS to treat Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia."

How is a temporary (high dose rate) brachytherapy done to treat prostate cancer?,"With this technique, hollow needles or hollow catheters are placed into the prostate gland, which are then filled with radioactive material (iridium-192 or cesium 137) for 5-15 minutes. After a period of minutes both the needles and the radioactive material are removed."
Who can get radioactive seed implants to treat prostate cancer?,"Radioactive seed implants are a form of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Therefore, the best candidates for these procedures are patients who have a cancer that is contained within the prostate and is not very aggressive. Rectal bleeding occurs in less than 1% of patients."
How is a permanent (low dose rate) brachytherapy done to treat prostate cancer?,"Anywhere from 40 to 100 seeds are commonly implanted. The implants remain in place permanently, and become biologically inert (no longer useful) after a period of months. This technique allows a high dose of radiation to be delivered to the prostate with limited damage to surrounding tissues. With this technique, hollow needles or hollow catheters are placed into the prostate gland, which are then filled with radioactive material (iridium-192 or cesium 137) for 5-15 minutes.

How can exercises trigger heartburn?,"This allows time for the food to pass out of the stomach and into the small intestine, rather than having it back up into the esophagus. Keep in mind that leg lifts also work the abdominal muscles and may aggravate heartburn symptoms too. Activities such as headstands and yoga moves like downward dog can reverse the natural flow of stomach contents and may trigger heartburn. Jarring exercises, such as jogging or aerobics, can slosh stomach contents around and upward if you have a weak LES. But never exercise on a full stomach. Doing so increases abdominal pressure, which makes heartburn more likely. Food takes several hours to digest so it really is a matter of what works for you. Most experts recommend waiting about two hours after eating before working out."
What medications can trigger heartburn?,"Heartburn is no reason not to exercise. But regular use of aspirin or a popular class of painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) may irritate the esophagus. NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and prescription Cox-2 inhibitors such as Celebrex. These drugs are often used to treat arthritis. Several different types of blood pressure medicines can also cause heartburn. Many blood pressure and heart disease medicines, including calcium channel blockers and nitrates, relax the LES muscle, making it easy for your stomach acids to retreat backwards. Always tell your doctor if a new prescription or over-the-counter medicine gives you heartburn or makes your heartburn worse."
How does the immune system work?,"Usually, cells of the immune system defend the body from harmful microbes -- bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other foreign substances -- that have entered it. This immune system response causes inflammation. Inflammation subsides. If the gene has changed or mutated in some way, your body's reaction to microbes may also be different from the normal reaction."
How does the immune system in a person with Crohn's disease work?,"This immune system response causes inflammation. For some reason, though, people with Crohn's disease have an immune system that reacts inappropriately. The immune system may be defending the body against helpful microbes by mistake."
What is ALS?,"A French doctor named Jean- Martin Charcot discovered the condition in 1869. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } ALS is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. It affects nerves in your brain and spinal cord that control your muscles. As your muscles get weaker, it gets harder for you to walk, talk, eat, and breathe. Some others include: primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS) progressive bulbar palsy ( PBP) pseudobulbar palsy With ALS, motor neurons in your brain and spinal cord break down and die. It affects up to 95% of people with the disease."
What are some other motor neuron diseases besides ALS?,"Some others include: primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS) progressive bulbar palsy ( PBP) pseudobulbar palsy With ALS, motor neurons in your brain and spinal cord break down and die. One change is to a gene that makes a protein called SOD1."
What is evening primrose oil?,"There is some good research showing that evening primrose oil may be helpful in eczema or atopic dermatitis. And some studies suggest that supplements that contain gamma-linolenic acid ( GLA), including evening primrose oil, may be of some benefit to people with rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is most concentrated in plant oils such as evening primrose oil and borage oil."
What are some precautions for taking evening primrose oil?,"Several other drug interactions have been noted. Evening primrose oil may cause seizures if used with anesthesia. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) does regulate dietary supplements; however, it treats them like foods rather than medications. Unlike drug manufacturers, the makers of supplements don't have to show their products are safe or effective before selling them on the market."
Should I avoid certain food or drugs while taking Aldactone for heart failure?,"Aldactone, an aldosterone inhibitor, is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Side effects you may experience with Aldactone include: Extreme tiredness: This side effect may be strongest when you first start taking Aldactone. Before this drug is prescribed, tell your doctor about all the other medications you are taking, particularly other drugs for high blood pressure, Sandimmune, potassium-containing drugs, digoxin, or lithium. Before this medication is prescribed, tell your doctor if you have diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, gout, a history of kidney stones, menstrual problems, or breast enlargement. Follow your doctor's dietary advice, which may include: following a low-sodium diet, or including (or avoiding) high-potassium foods (such as bananas and orange juice) in your diet."
How is Aldactone used to treat heart failure?,"Aldactone is usually prescribed to prevent heart failure symptoms from becoming worse. Aldactone protects the heart by blocking a certain chemical (aldosterone) in the body that causes salt and fluid build-up. When receiving aldactone, you may be given a low dose that does not provide enough diuretic effects by itself. Your doctor may prescribe another type of diuretic in addition to aldactone. Here are some guidelines for taking food and medicine with Aldactone: Aldactone is generally prescribed in combination with an ACE inhibitor, digoxin, other diuretic and beta-blocker."
What is Aldactone?,"Aldactone is usually prescribed to prevent heart failure symptoms from becoming worse. Here are some guidelines for taking food and medicine with Aldactone: Aldactone is generally prescribed in combination with an ACE inhibitor, digoxin, other diuretic and beta-blocker."
What are other Aldactone guidelines?,"The number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and how long you need to take the medication will depend on your condition. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week. While taking this drug, have your blood pressure and kidney function tested regularly, as advised by your doctor. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory so that your response to this medication can be monitored."
What are the symptoms of ischemic colitis?,"You may notice: Bloody poop Pain on your left side Urgent need to go Diarrhea Nausea Swollen belly Doctors often can't pinpoint the cause of ischemic colitis. This condition results from a blocked artery. If you have ischemic colitis and have pain on your right side or sudden belly pain that's so severe you can't find a comfortable position, head to the ER or call 911. The artery feeding the right side of your colon also feeds part of the small intestine. A blockage there can quickly damage or kill tissue. If this life-threatening situation occurs, you'll need surgery to clear the blockage and to remove the damaged part of the intestine."
When are you more likely to get leg cramps?,"While they can strike people of all ages, if you're 50 or older you might get them more often. Stand too long on hard surfaces. Drink plenty of water."
What are the sex- and age- related prevalence of leg cramps?,"While they can strike people of all ages, if you're 50 or older you might get them more often. If you have frequent and severe leg cramps, talk to your doctor."
How can gum disease be prevented?,"Family history of dental disease can be a contributing factor for the development of gingivitis. Proper plaque control consists of professional cleanings at least twice a year and daily brushing and flossing. Brushing eliminates plaque from the surfaces of the teeth that can be reached; flossing removes food particles and plaque from in between the teeth and under the gum line. Antibacterial mouth rinses can reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease, according to the American Dental Association."
Is gum disease linked to other health problems?,"The body's immune system fights the bacteria as the plaque spreads and grows below the gum line. In some people, gum disease may affect only certain teeth, such as the molars. Treatment options depend on the stage of disease, how you may have responded to earlier treatments, and your overall health. Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for development of periodontitis."
When does atrial flutter occur?,"It beats extra-fast, about 250-400 beats per minute. The beat slows down when the signals reach the AV node, a bundle of cells in the upper wall of muscle between the ventricles, your heart's lower chambers. Because atrial flutter comes from the atria, it is called a supraventricular (above the ventricles) tachycardia. ( This is called cardioversion.)"
Does atrial flutter increase your risk of getting a stroke?,"Persistent atrial flutter is more or less permanent. Prevent stroke : This devastating complication of atrial flutter happens when a piece of a blood clot formed in your heart breaks off and travels to the brain, where it blocks blood flow. This lowers the odds that a blood clot will form in the heart or in a blood vessel and lead to a stroke. Atrial flutter does raise your chance of having a stroke."
What should you do if you have symptoms of atrial flutter but your electrocardiogram results are normal?,"Others describe: Palpitations (rapid heartbeat or a pounding or fluttering sensation in the chest) Shortness of breath Anxiety People with heart or lung disease who have atrial flutter may have these and other, more significant symptoms: Angina pectoris (chest or heart pains) Feeling faint or light-headed Syncope (fainting) Call your doctor: If you have any of the symptoms of atrial flutter If you're taking medication for atrial flutter, and you have any of the signs and symptoms described If you've been diagnosed and are being treated for atrial flutter, go immediately to a hospital emergency department if you: Have severe chest pain Feel faint or light-headed Faint When you tell him your symptoms, your doctor will probably suspect an arrhythmia. Also, you can't get treatment until the doctor knows your specific arrhythmia type. That can happen because arrhythmia comes and goes. Or you may just have premature heartbeats, which aren't dangerous. This test can help your doctor find out if you have a significant arrhythmia and what type. If you have no serious symptoms, you may get medications by mouth. Atrial flutter does raise your chance of having a stroke."
How is defibrillation used to treat atrial flutter?,That can happen because arrhythmia comes and goes. ( This is called cardioversion.) The goal of treatment is to convert the atrial flutter to a normal sinus rhythm and make sure it doesn't come back. The first step in treatment is to restore a normal rate and sinus rhythm. These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal.
How is catheter ablation (radiofrequency ablation) used to treat atrial flutter?,"Atrial flutter results from an abnormal circuit inside the right atrium, or upper chamber of your heart. In some people, no root cause is ever found. Prevent stroke : This devastating complication of atrial flutter happens when a piece of a blood clot formed in your heart breaks off and travels to the brain, where it blocks blood flow. Radiofrequency ablation: This is a type of catheter ablation most often used for atrial flutter."
What controls the beating of the heart?,"The beat slows down when the signals reach the AV node, a bundle of cells in the upper wall of muscle between the ventricles, your heart's lower chambers. Because atrial flutter comes from the atria, it is called a supraventricular (above the ventricles) tachycardia. These tests can tell a lot about what's happening with your heart: Electrocardiogram ( EKG): Measures and records the electrical impulses that control your heartbeat Highlights problems in these impulses and abnormalities in the heart The tracings can help pinpoint the type of arrhythmia and where in the heart it comes from."
What kinds of medications are used for atrial flutter?,"It identifies heart valve problems, checks how well your ventricles work, and looks for blood clots in the atria. The goals are to control the heart rate, restore a normal sinus rhythm, prevent future episodes, and prevent stroke. The classes of medications used in atrial flutter are: Heart rate medicines: The most common way to treat atrial fibrillation is with drugs that control your heartbeat. Most people take a medication called digoxin ( Lanoxin). Some are called beta-blockers. These treatments are sometimes called chemical cardioversion: Sodium channel blockers, which slow your heart's ability to conduct electricity: Flecainide ( Tambocor) Propafenone ( Rythmol) Quinidine Potassium channel blockers, which slow the electrical signals that cause AFib: Amiodarone ( Cordarone, Nexterone Pacerone), Dofetilide ( Tikosyn) Sotalol ( Betapace, Sorine, Sotylize) Anticoagulants: These drugs make your blood less able to clot. This lowers the odds that a blood clot will form in the heart or in a blood vessel and lead to a stroke."
What does the heart do?,"The beat slows down when the signals reach the AV node, a bundle of cells in the upper wall of muscle between the ventricles, your heart's lower chambers. But atrial flutter can result from: Diseases or other problems in the heart A disease elsewhere in your body that affects the heart Substances that change the way your heart transmits electrical impulses Heart diseases or problems that can cause atrial flutter include: Ischemia : Lower blood flow to the heart due to coronary heart disease, hardening of the arteries, or a blood clot Hypertension : High blood pressure Cardiomyopathy : Disease of the heart muscle Abnormal heart valves: Especially the mitral valve Hypertrophy: An enlarged chamber of the heart Open-heart surgery Diseases elsewhere in your body that affect the heart include: Hyperthyroidism : An overactive thyroid gland Pulmonary embolism : A blood clot in a blood vessel in the lungs Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ): A condition that lowers the amount of oxygen in your blood Substances that may contribute to atrial flutter include: Alcohol (wine, beer, or hard liquor) Stimulants like cocaine, amphetamines, diet pills, cold medicines, and even caffeine Some people have no symptoms at all with atrial flutter. They slow your heart rate and cut the strength of contractions."

Is atrial flutter life-threatening?,"Atrial flutter is a problem with way your heart beats. Complications of atrial flutter can be devastating, but treatment almost always prevents them."
Why should heavy drinkers get a pneumonia vaccine?,"As you age, your immune system doesn't work as well as it once did. If you have heart disease, diabetes, emphysema, asthma, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you're more likely to have a weakened immune system, which makes you more likely to get pneumonia."
What are the risks of getting a pneumonia vaccine?,"If it's flu season, you can even get a pneumonia vaccine at the same time that you get a flu vaccine, as long as you receive each shot in a different arm. PCV13 helps protect people from 13 of the most severe types of bacteria that cause pneumonia. But some people have mild side effects from the vaccine, including: Swelling, soreness, or redness where you got the shot Mild fever Fussiness or irritability Loss of appetite Sore muscles Fewer than 1% of people who get the pneumonia vaccine have these types of side effects. Allergic reactions are even rarer."

What are some grooming checklist for caregivers for people with cancer?,"A woman with cancer might feel more confident and in control when she takes care of how she looks. For safety, use an electric shaver. For someone getting chemotherapy, remind her to brush her teeth after she eats to avoid infection. Offer waxed dental floss, a soft-bristle toothbrush, and fluoride toothpaste without whitening or tartar control. Talk to her doctor about flossing if her gums bleed and she has low levels of platelets in her blood. Make a mouth rinse by mixing 1/2 teaspoon baking soda with 1 cup of water for her to use after each brush. Don't use store-bought mouthwash. It can have alcohol or chemicals that may irritate her mouth."
What ways can I change the habits in my bathroom to better treat multiple sclerosis?,"In the Bathroom Use an elevated toilet seat or safety rails to make it easier to sit and stand. Do not use towel racks or bathroom tissue holders to help you stand. They're not sturdy enough. Install grab bars inside and outside the bathtub or shower. Use a bathtub transfer bench or a shower chair with back support. Put extended lever handles on faucets to make them easier to turn. Put a nonskid mat in the bathtub. Use a handheld hose for showering and bathing. Use a long-handled sponge or scrubbing brush. Use soap-on-a-rope, bath mitts, or sponges with soap inside instead of bar soap. Use lukewarm water. Very hot water can make you tired and aggravate your symptoms. Sew straps on towels to make them easier to hold while you dry yourself. Place a towel on the floor outside the tub to dry your feet so you don't slip. Put a towel on the back of your chair and rub your back against it to dry. Use toothbrushes with built-up handles or use an electric toothbrush. Use utensils with built-up, lightweight handles."
How can Tay-Sachs disease be prevented?,"Tay- Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. If both parents are carriers of Tay- Sachs disease, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will get the disease. You can have a blood test that analyzes your genes or the levels of the Hex- A protein in your blood to tell you whether you are a carrier. If two people planning to have children find out they're both carriers, a genetic counselor can help them review the options for lowering the chances of having a baby with Tay- Sachs."
Who gets Tay-Sachs disease?,"Tay- Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. But babies born with Tay- Sachs disease inherited a mutated copy of the gene from both parents, so they don't make any Hex- A protein. A baby born with Tay- Sachs grows normally until 3 to 6 months of age. Non- Jewish French Canadians living near the St. Lawrence River in Canada and in the Cajun community of Louisiana also have a higher incidence of Tay- Sachs. If both parents are carriers of Tay- Sachs disease, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will get the disease."
What are symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease?,"Tay- Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. A baby born with Tay- Sachs grows normally until 3 to 6 months of age. Around this time, parents might notice their baby's development start to slow and the muscles weaken. Gradually, the disease causes more symptoms in babies, including: A loss of motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling A very strong reaction to loud noises Trouble focusing on objects or following them with their eyes Cherry-red spots, which can be identified with an eye examination, in the eyes By age 2, most children with Tay- Sachs have started getting more severe problems. They can include: Swallowing and breathing issues that keep getting worse Seizures Loss of mental function, hearing, and sight Paralysis Past age 3, there are few visible changes in children with Tay- Sachs, but the nervous system continues to go downhill, often leading to death by age 5."
What should I expect from Tay-Sachs disease later in life?,"Tay- Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. A baby born with Tay- Sachs grows normally until 3 to 6 months of age. Like the version of the disease that affects infants, the Tay- Sachs that starts later in life is caused by HEXA gene mutations. Symptoms might start to appear anywhere from the teen years to adulthood. Early symptoms often include clumsiness, problems balancing, and muscle weakness in the legs. People with it may also have mental health issues. Late-onset Tay- Sachs doesn't always shorten life span."
What causes Tay-Sachs disease?,"Tay- Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. Defects in a gene called HEXA cause Tay- Sachs. Some people have just one normal copy of the gene, and they still make enough Hex- A protein to keep the brain and spinal cord healthy. But babies born with Tay- Sachs disease inherited a mutated copy of the gene from both parents, so they don't make any Hex- A protein. This is what makes them become so sick. Over time, GM2 ganglioside builds up in their nervous system and starts to cause damage."
What treatments and programs can help my child with Tay-Sachs disease?,"Tay- Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. A baby born with Tay- Sachs grows normally until 3 to 6 months of age. They can provide ways to help your baby keep the suck-swallow reflex going as well as help you figure out when it is time to consider a feeding tube for your little one. These specialists can help you manage your baby's seizures with medication.

This type of cancer is usually in one of three stages: Stage IIIB: All Inflammatory breast cancers start in this stage since they involve the skin of your breast. It may include: Chemotherapy . This drug treatment is given before surgery to shrink the tumor and make the cancer operable. It also lowers the chance the cancer will come back. Surgery. A mastectomy may be performed after chemotherapy. Hormone therapy. Certain medications may be given if the cancer cells have hormone receptors. These medicines block the receptors so they can't attach to the hormones. Radiation . Often, radiation treatments are given after chemotherapy and surgery to lower the chance of the cancer coming back."
What tests are used to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer?,"When compared to other forms of the disease, inflammatory breast cancer: Looks different -- often there are no lumps, but your breast might appear red, swollen, or inflamed Is harder to diagnose -- it doesn't show up well on a mammogram Is more aggressive and spreads more quickly than other types Tends to be diagnosed at a younger age, especially among African- American women Is more likely to affect overweight women Is often further along (your doctor may call this locally advanced, meaning it's moved into nearby skin) when it's diagnosed Has often spread past the breast (your doctor will say it has metastasized) when it's diagnosed, which makes it harder to treat Unlike more common types of breast cancer, this type generally doesn't show up as a lump. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. PET scan . Used together with a CT scan, this test can help find cancer in lymph nodes and other areas of the body. If you're diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer, more tests can show how much of the breast and the area around it is affected."
How does Crohn's disease occur?,"The disease, though, can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal system. Thus, the disorder may affect the large or small intestine, the stomach, the esophagus, or even the mouth. Crohn's can occur at any age. It is most commonly diagnosed in people who are between the ages of 15 and 30. An upper endoscopy may also be used to look down the esophagus, into the stomach and the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum."
What kinds of drugs are used to treat Crohn's disease?,"The first step usually involves reducing inflammation. Many people are first treated with sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine). Mesalamine ( Asacol, Canasa, Pentasa) is another 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5- ASA medication. Possible side effects of sulfasalazine and other mesalamine-containing drugs may include: nausea vomiting diarrhea heartburn headache If a person does not respond to sulfasalazine, the doctor may prescribe other types of drugs that contain 5- ASA. These other products include: olsalazine ( Dipentum) balsalazide ( Colazal, Giazol) mesalamine ( Asacol, Lialda, Pentasa, and others) Corticosteroids such as prednisone are another class of drugs that reduce inflammation.
